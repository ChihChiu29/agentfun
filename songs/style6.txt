Style 1: Emo Rap / Cloud Rap

A melancholic and atmospheric beat with heavy use of reverb and delay on the vocals. The delivery should be emotional and raw, almost like a spoken-word confession over a dreamy, hazy instrumental. The focus is on creating a sense of introspection and heartbreak. The beat should be slow, with a prominent, simple melody and sparse, echoing percussion. Think of artists like XXXTENTACION or Lil Peep.

Style 2: Lo-Fi Hip Hop

A chill, nostalgic beat with a jazzy feel. The instrumental should feature a simple piano or guitar loop, a relaxed drum pattern with a clear snare, and perhaps some vinyl crackle for texture. The vocal delivery should be laid-back and conversational, with a touch of sadness. The overall vibe should be perfect for a late-night drive or staring out a rain-streaked window. The focus is on the mood and the story.

Style 3: Trap

A modern, hard-hitting trap beat with deep 808s, rapid-fire hi-hats, and a dark, cinematic melody. The vocal delivery should be more aggressive and rhythmic, with faster flows and ad-libs to emphasize the pain and anger in the lyrics. The chorus can have a more melodic, sung-rap style for contrast. This style would highlight the feeling of being trapped in a cycle of heartbreak and despair.

Style 4: Old School Boom Bap

A classic boom bap beat with a heavy, head-nodding drum break and a sampled soul or jazz melody. The focus is on the lyricism and the raw emotion of the story. The vocal delivery should be clear and direct, with a steady, confident flow that rides the beat. This style would give the song a timeless, storytelling quality, emphasizing the narrative of the lost love.

Style 5: Melodic Rap

A modern, melodic beat with a strong focus on a catchy, sung chorus. The verses can be a mix of singing and rapping, with a smooth, auto-tuned vocal delivery. The instrumental should be polished and radio-friendly, with a memorable synth or piano melody and a clean, modern drum pattern. This style would make the song more accessible and emotionally resonant for a wider audience, think of artists like The Kid LAROI or Post Malone.
