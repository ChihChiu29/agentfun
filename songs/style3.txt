Style 1: Old School Hip Hop
"Create a beat that captures the golden era of hip hop. Think boom-bap drums, a groovy bassline, and a sampled jazz or funk melody. The vibe should be nostalgic, reminiscent of 90s New York street culture. The tempo should be around 90-95 BPM, perfect for a laid-back, confident flow."

Style 2: Trap
"Produce a modern trap beat with a dark and atmospheric vibe. Use a heavy 808 bass, skittering hi-hats, and a haunting synth melody. The tempo should be around 140-150 BPM, creating a sense of urgency and energy. The overall mood should be aggressive and intense, perfect for a rapper with a powerful delivery."

Style 3: Lofi Hip Hop
"Craft a chill and relaxing lofi hip hop beat. Use a dusty drum break, a warm and mellow piano or guitar sample, and some subtle vinyl crackle for texture. The tempo should be slow, around 70-80 BPM, creating a dreamy and introspective atmosphere. The mood should be perfect for a late-night study session or a lazy Sunday afternoon."

Style 4: West Coast G-Funk
"Produce a classic G-funk track with a smooth and funky feel. Use a deep, melodic bassline, a laid-back drum groove, and a high-pitched synthesizer lead. The tempo should be around 85-95 BPM, perfect for cruising in a lowrider. The vibe should be sunny and confident, with a touch of gangster attitude."

Style 5: Drill
"Create a hard-hitting drill beat with a menacing and aggressive tone. Use a sliding 808 bass, complex hi-hat patterns, and a dark, orchestral sample. The tempo should be around 140-145 BPM, creating a sense of tension and danger. The mood should be raw and gritty, reflecting the harsh realities of street life."
