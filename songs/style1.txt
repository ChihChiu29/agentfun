A melancholic and introspective hip-hop track. The beat is slow and atmospheric, with a prominent lo-fi piano melody and a simple, heavy drum machine pattern. A deep, resonant bassline provides a sense of urban melancholy. The overall mood is reflective and slightly somber, but with a glimmer of hope. The vocal delivery is a smooth, narrative rap, with a clear and steady flow, conveying a sense of honesty and vulnerability. The chorus is more melodic, with a touch of soulful singing, adding to the emotional weight of the track.
