任性 (Willful Flow)

(Verse 1)
走過了風雨, yeah, through the storms and the low low lows
看過了高低, seen the highs, now we on the road
你始終安靜, always quiet, a silent soul
像孩子仰望星星, like a kid watching stars, you make me whole
I read your eyes, yeah, I see it all, 一覽無遺
This dirty world, this human nature, a tragedy
捨不得你獨自闖, can't let you face this humanity
命運讓我們相遇, destiny brought you to me
You had your doubts, but now you see, 我就是證明

(Chorus)
So I'm doing it for you, 為了你勇敢任性
Yeah, this world can be cruel, a maze, but I'm all in
總有一天這一切變成回憶, one day it's all just a memory
所有風雨都會是人生風景, every storm just a painted scenery
Yeah, I do it for you, 為了你勇敢任性
They can say what they want, let 'em talk, let 'em spin
就算最後所有人與我為敵, even if the whole world is my enemy
I'll never regret it, 'cause I loved you, 全心全意

(Verse 2)
這世界破破爛爛, a broken world, a shattered frame
為了你縫縫釘釘, but for you, I'm rebuilding the game
此刻的轟轟烈烈, this blazing fire, this burning flame
都會是點點滴滴, will be the drops that spell your name
想活成鏗鏘砂礫, wanna be the grit, hard and true
去為你擊碎陰影, to break the shadows coming for you
再煉成無瑕琉璃, then melt it down to flawless glass, brand new
折射出璀璨光影, reflecting every light that's true
I'd lose it all, yeah, I'd break the law, 為你叛道離經
Like a renegade wing, a rebel king,拒絕引力

(Chorus)
So I'm doing it for you, 為了你勇敢任性
Yeah, this world can be cruel, a maze, but I'm all in
總有一天這切變成回憶, one day it's all just a memory
所有風雨都會是人生風景, every storm just a painted scenery
Yeah, I do it for you, 為了你勇敢任性
They can say what they want, let 'em talk, let 'em spin
就算最後所有人與我為敵, even if the whole world is my enemy
I'll never regret it, 'cause I loved you, 全心全意

(Bridge)
Yeah, I loved your wild side, 你的任性
The fire in your eyes, I was all in
They talk and they talk, let 'em all fade to dust
In this world of rust, it's in you I trust
I see the stars in your eyes, no compromise
Against the pull of the earth, we're gonna rise

(Outro)
哄著你, 陪著你, for you, I'm on this ride
I loved your willful side, yeah, deep inside
For you, for you...
勇敢任性... for you...

多年 (So Many Years)

(Verse 1)
Yeah, just another late night, memory lane
與你並肩的日常, flashes of you in my brain
快樂的模樣, the way you smiled, man, it was my everything
是我沒說出的嚮往, the silent wish I kept deep within
那年共度的時光, yeah, back in the days, the school hallway flow
教室的走廊, just two kids, caught in the afterglow
曾是兩個人的瘋狂, our own kinda crazy, a two-person show
Now I'm just a ghost, tell me, where did you go?
我已經沒辦法成為你的誰, I guess I can't be your somebody now
你有沒有偶爾的想過我, but do you ever stop and think of me somehow?

(Chorus)
這麼多年, so many years have passed me by
多希望願望實現, wishin' on the stars up in the sky
多希望你在身邊, wishin' you were still right by my side
不想翻舊照片, don't wanna look at photos, I can't lie
把記憶都當成了紀念, turning every memory to a souvenir
這麼多年, it's been so many, many years
多希望夢都實現, hopin' that my dreams would all come clear
多希望承諾兌現, hopin' that your promises were real
為什麼總是深陷, why am I still trapped inside this fear?
誰記得我們存在過, does anyone remember we were here?

(Verse 2)
與你錯過的日落, the sunsets that we missed, do they even count?
算不算擁有, if I ain't got you, what's the right amount?
此刻就沒有了以後, this moment has no future, full of doubt
那天追逐的大雨, the rain we chased that day, a heavy cloud
快把我淹沒, it's drowning me now, a silent shout
剩我一個人的自救, just me, myself, and I, tryna figure it out
我已經沒辦法成為你的誰, I guess I can't be your somebody now
你有沒有偶爾的想過我, but do you ever stop and think of me somehow?

(Bridge)
Was it my fault? Was it all on me? 是不是我的錯?
Why'd you turn away and let me go? 為什麼那天你不再回頭?
You have any idea what it's like? Livin' all this time alone?
你知不知道這些年我一個人是怎麼過來的?
The silence is a monster in my home, yeah.

(Chorus)
這麼多年, so many years have passed me by
多希望願望實現, wishin' on the stars up in the sky
多希望你在身邊, wishin' you were still right by my side
不想翻舊照片, don't wanna look at photos, I can't lie
把記憶都當成了紀念, turning every memory to a souvenir
這麼多年, it's been so many, many years
多希望夢都實現, hopin' that my dreams would all come clear
多希望承諾兌現, hopin' that your promises were real
為什麼總是深陷, why am I still trapped inside this fear?

左邊 (By My Side)

(Verse 1)
Before I met you, the world I knew was cold
充滿了荊棘, a story untold
遍布了滿地的深淵, walking on a path with nowhere to go
Then you came and caught me, your gentle soul
用溫柔接住我, you caught me when I was about to fall
快崩塌的世界, you rebuilt my world, you fixed it all
Yeah, my world was crumbling, a total wreck
Then you put your hand on my shoulder, saved me from the edge

(Chorus)
You're the one who's always on my left side, a star in my dark night
依然站在我左邊の人, you're the one who makes it all feel right
他總保護我沒有淚痕, you wipe away my tears, hold me tight
願你不再黑暗裡沈淪, hope you never sink into the night
你就是個星辰, 'cause baby, you're a star, burning so bright
依然站在我左邊的他, always right there, my guiding light
不管黑夜還是清晨, through the darkness and the morning time
總會無條件給我一盞燈, you're the lamp that's always gonna shine

(Verse 2)
After I met you, the world I see is new
是一個溫暖, a garden full of me and you
遍布了滿地的花園, a universe of color, fresh and true
謝謝你總是能用耐心守候著, thank you for the patience, for seeing me through
非常不完美的我, this imperfect soul, you made it feel brand new
You waited for me, you stayed for me, yeah
Your love's the only therapy, yeah

(Chorus)
You're the one who's always on my left side, a star in my dark night
依然站在我左邊の人, you're the one who makes it all feel right
他總保護我沒有淚痕, you wipe away my tears, hold me tight
願你不再黑暗裡沈淪, hope you never sink into the night
你就是個星辰, 'cause baby, you're a star, burning so bright
依然站在我左邊的他, always right there, my guiding light
不管黑夜還是清晨, through the darkness and the morning time
總會無條件給我一盞燈, you're the lamp that's always gonna shine

(Bridge)
Let's seal this moment, keep the happiness locked inside, 只想把快樂全都封存
'Cause with you, I'm ready for the ride, 不怕與你並肩風雨裡
Let the world do its worst, we'll survive, 共度朝夕浮塵
願你能永遠保持單純, hope you always keep that simple heart of yours
世界莫辜負你, may the world be good to you, may it open all the doors
奮不顧身, 'cause you gave your all, and I'm forever yours

(Outro)
The one on my left side...
Yeah, you...
Always by my side...

算什麼 (What Am I)

(Verse 1)
Yo, tell me what's the deal, the gentle touch now feels so fake
怎麼溫柔變得有點刺痛, every word you say just makes me break
怎麼問候越問卻越寂寞, the more you ask, the more my heart just aches
你說我沒從前那麼灑脫, you say I'm not as free as I used to be
卻在問題背後藏著解脫, but I see you hidin' your escape key, let's be real
拜託, if this pain's a sculpture, you carve it with a smile
如果感受不能不假思索, if I can't feel without thinking for a while
如果我們只是如果, if we're just an 'if', a game of denial... then what?

(Chorus)
到底我算什麼? WHAT AM I?
真的要我走多一槍就夠, if you want me gone, one shot and I'll die
不囉嗦, no more talk, just aim it at the pain
瞄準傷口, pull the trigger, let it rain
到底我算什麼? HUH? WHAT AM I?
拜託說出口別吊人胃口, just say the words, don't leave me hanging high
我不用乾淨俐落, don't need it clean, don't need a clean slate
不留線索, just the ugly truth, I'll take the bait

(Verse 2)
Oh, I get it now, your gentleness was just an act of grace
原來溫柔也是一種灑脫, your way of leaving without a trace
才讓問候變成一種解脫, so every 'how you doing' was 'gimme space'
我懂, yeah, I get it, crystal clear in this empty place
如果難過還得細心雕豁, if sadness needs to be a work of art
如果感受不能不假思索, if feelings need a script right from the start
如果我們只是如果, if we're just an 'if' from which you wanna part... then what?

(Chorus)
到底我算什麼? WHAT AM I?
真的要我走多一槍就夠, if you want me gone, one shot and I'll die
不囉嗦, no more talk, just aim it at the pain
瞄準傷口, pull the trigger, let it rain
到底我算什麼? HUH? WHAT AM I?
拜託說出口別吊人胃口, just say the words, don't leave me hanging high
我不用乾淨俐落, don't need it clean, don't need a clean slate
不留線索, just the ugly truth, I'll take the bait

(Bridge)
明明就明白了什麼! I already know what's up
明明就其實也都懂! Deep down, yeah, I know we're stuck
我明明是自作自受! It's my own damn fault, I'm the one to blame
我的手用來抓著我! My hands are tied up in this losing game
你的手拜託推我走! So use your hand, and push me out the door!
瞄準傷口! Aim for the wound, what you waiting for?!

(Outro)
到底我算什麼?
Just tell me!
多一槍就夠!
Yeah...
到底我算什麼?
Just tell me what I am...
說出口...
Just say it...

海 (The Sea)

(Verse 1)
Yeah, the alarm clock is a knock on my soul, 靈魂的敲擊
Another morning, man, I ain't feelin' whole, 翻來覆去
The light through the window, a hazy design, 撲朔迷離
Is it yesterday's ghost that I can't leave behind? 回憶不甘離去
Let the hangover win, I ain't even gonna fight, 只能讓宿醉肆意
Tonight the city lights are whispering low, 溫熱的耳語
Lookin' out at the street, watchin' the people flow, 目光的到達之地
Thinkin' 'bout the future, thinkin' 'bout the past, 未來和過去
Winter's comin' and this feelin's gonna last, 惆悵心情
Blame it on the weather, unstable and cold, 怪罪天氣不穩定
But really it's your eyes, the story I was sold, a story to be told
想起你的雙眼我的宿命, yeah, my destiny.

(Chorus)
從未見過的海, a sea I've never seen before
在你眼裡浮現出來, in your eyes, it crashes on the shore
拍打著寂寞等待, the lonely waves, they wait and they roar
變成眼淚流了下來, then they turn to tears and ask for more
從未見過的海, a whole new tide I can't ignore
若是天地雲煙消散, if the world just vanished, I'm not sure
I'd even notice, 'cause you're what I'm looking for
悲傷與快樂並排, the joy and sorrow, side by side
不分晝夜我全部都愛, day and night, I'm hypnotized.

(Verse 2)
External desires, they burn me out, leave a scar, 外在的慾望讓我燒傷了平靜
Internal voices, you're my guiding star, 內在的聲音是你給我的憧憬
What's the meaning of life? Do I chase or do I listen? 活著的意義在於追尋還是聽從命運
When the night comes and my mind is clear, there's no competition
如果夜裡的我保持清醒, if I'm awake and sober in the dark
那就是對你深深著迷, it means you're the one who's left a mark.
A permanent mark.

(Chorus)
從未見過的海, a sea I've never seen before
在你眼裡浮現出來, in your eyes, it crashes on the shore
拍打著寂寞等待, the lonely waves, they wait and they roar
變成眼淚流了下來, then they turn to tears and ask for more
從未見過的海, a whole new tide I'can't ignore
若是天地雲煙消散, if the world just vanished, I'm not sure
I'd even notice, 'cause you're what I'm looking for
悲傷與快樂並排, the joy and sorrow, side by side
不分晝夜我全部都愛, day and night, I'm hypnotized.

(Outro)
A sea I've never seen, now I see it in us both
在我們眼裡浮現出來, a new horizon, a sacred oath
命運的遺憾空白, the blank regrets of destiny's design
變成眼淚流了下來, turn to tears, but this time they're yours and mine
從未見過的海, in this endless ocean, we're the sign
茫茫天地雲煙消散, let the world around us just decline
悲傷與快樂同在, joy and sorrow, perfectly aligned
告訴我們不要再等待, telling us to stop waiting for a sign.

白夜 (White Night)

(Verse 1)
You got something to say, but you leave it hanging there, 你有話沒說不是嗎
In a moment, the silence is too much to bear, 瞬間沉默一切放大
But then you stroke my cheek, a touch so light, 但你又輕撫我臉頰
Like a flower growing in the dead of night, 不攤在陽光下也長出枝芽
How can I ignore it? This beautiful lie? 怎樣能無視它
A little sting in my heart, I felt it die, 心扎了一下

(Chorus)
I'd rather you just tell me "no", say it to my face, 情願你親口說 對我說一聲不
Don't let me think there's a way out of this empty place, 別讓我又以為在盡頭還有出路
Don't pretend there's hope when it's all just a lie, 別假装在絕望的盡頭就是希望
Your "kindness" is a lie, a white lie, a good-bye, 白色善意的謊 還是說謊
Love is kind, but it forgets so fast, 愛有多善良 就有多善忘

(Verse 2)
Your kindness is more terrifying than your weakness, that's a fact, 示好比示弱更可怕
Mixing up the truth, there's no turning back, 模糊問題真中有假
A little bit of love, a little bit of hate, 珍惜與可惜半摻雜
You wanna take it all, or leave it all to fate, 兩者你都全拿 或者都丟下
Do you love me, do you not? You got a line for that, 愛嗎或是不愛 你都有說法
But I'm done with the games, yeah, I'm through with that.

(Chorus)
I'd rather you just tell me "no", say it to my face, 情願你親口說 對我說一聲不
Don't let me think my good luck hasn't run out of space, 別讓我又竊喜好運氣還沒結束
Don't pretend there's hope when it's all just a lie, 別假装在絕望的盡頭就是希望
The sun in this white night, it's not the moon in the sky, 白夜裡的太陽 不是月亮
This dying radiance, a beautiful, empty high, 彌留的燦爛 燦爛得虛妄

(Bridge)
It's like a white night sun, isn't it? 像白夜太陽對嗎
Your dawn is also the dusk, a perfect fit, 你的曙光也是暮光
The same gold, the same sorrow, we can't quit, 同樣的金黃 同樣的悲愴
This beautiful, tragic script.

Not the sun... not the moon...
Just a beautiful lie...
An illusion...
虛妄...

我会等 (Still Waiting)

Plant a million wishes for you, all over the place, 把所有心愿都在夜空种下

I'll be waitin', 我会等冬的雪融化蒲扇里的夏

I believe in you and this dream, it's gonna find its way, 相信美梦和你总有一天会预先到达

(Verse 2)
Yeah, I'm tryna learn the magic, how to write the future script, 续写未来的魔法
Put it all in my hands, with a steady grip, 把所有未来都写在我笔下
Thought I had the perfect answer on my lip, 想過給你最完美的回答
But the rain don't know when it's supposed to stop, 我想雨也不知道何时能停下
Even the strongest people feel they're gonna drop, 再坚强的人也会偷偷想家
So I just wipe my tears and treat 'em like they're sweat, 学会了眼泪当做汗水偷偷地擦
I ain't given up on us yet.

(Bridge)
Yeah, I still believe
This ain't make-believe
The world keeps turning, my heart keeps burning
For that one day, that one return
I know it's coming, yeah.

(Chorus)
I'll be waitin', 我会等枯树生出芽开出新的花
I'll be waitin', for the sun to pierce the dark, that first朝霞
I'll be waitin', for the rain to wash it all away, 把回忆都冲刷

清單 (The List)

(Verse 1)
Scrolling through my phone again, another lonely night
其實有些地方永遠都去不了, some places we'll never see in this life
But I still saved them, yeah, 我還是記下來了
'Cause I could see you there, with the stars in your eyes, 一看那些地方就是你會喜歡的
我就默默存下來了, I kept it quiet, a secret plan inside
耗費幾天幾夜又有多難呢, spending a few nights, man that ain't no sacrifice
我不想要用緣分解釋的人生, I don't want a life that's just explained away by fate
慢慢假的也像是真的, if you fake it long enough, it starts to feel great... or does it?

(Chorus)
The wishlist in my heart, 願望清單裡的都是以為能夠實現的
Every single dream, I tore 'em all apart, 夢想一個一個完成了刪去了
Checked off every box, played every single part
But in the end, the only one that's left is you, 最後也只剩下一個你了
Yeah, in the end, the only one that's left is you.

(Verse 2)
This pocket list is heavy, full of ghosts and shattered glass
口袋名單裡的還擱在那裏無法完成, a future that was never meant to pass
Now I understand the meaning of a wish, 才知道許了願望就代表遺憾
To make a wish is to acknowledge what you miss
而你是所有願望裡最難實現的那個, and you... you're the hardest wish upon that list
The one I can't check off, the one that still persists.
就算是假的我也當真了, even if it's fake, I treated it as true. Now what do I do?

(Bridge)
You know...
有時候製造記憶的不是旅程
Sometimes the memory isn't the trip you take
而是出發之時沒同行的人
It's the person who wasn't with you when you walked away.
That's the realest thing.

(Chorus)
The wishlist in my heart, 願望清單裡的都是以為能夠實現的
Every single dream, I tore 'em all apart, 夢想一個一個完成了刪去了
Checked off every box, played every single part
But in the end, the only one that's left is you, 最後也只剩下一個你了
Yeah, in the end, the hardest wish to see come true... was you.

3am (Don't Call)

(Chorus)
Don't call me at 3am
Saying you need somebody, that you need a helping hand
需要一個人照顧, but I can't be that man
刪去的那些舊照片, yeah I deleted all the photos that we had
早已帶走我所有對你的感覺, took away the feelings, left the good with the bad
我就是不吃回頭草, I don't double back, no, that's not my style
So bye bye 願你幸福, go and find your happiness, it might take a while
There's no way that I'm coming back to you. Not now.

(Verse 1)
遊樂園門前分手的那天, yeah, the day we broke up at the amusement park
Tried to talk some sense, but you just fell apart, 試著講道理你卻紅了雙眼
Promises we made, now they're just marks in the dark, 沒能兌現是你在身邊
I was so damn foolish, thought our love had no end, 愚蠢的我怎麼會相信愛沒期限
I don't wanna pick up my phone when it rings, no
不斷地騙過自己故事有美好结局, keep lying to myself that we could have a happy ending
Tried to fix it all, but the ball never moved, man, 試著挽回關係像瞄準遠方出了擊, 球卻依然留在原地
破碎不堪的回憶就讓它慢慢透明, let the broken memories just slowly fade to nothing.

(Bridge)
And maybe I'm the one to blame
For wanting to keep you in this picture frame
退回陌生人之後, after we went back to being strangers
情感總會冷卻不再失落, feelings supposed to cool down, avoid the dangers
But I guess I'm a fool, 'cause the truth is, I still feel the cold
怪我只想把你留在歌中, my fault for only wanting to keep you in the songs I hold
Just to tell a story that's getting old.

(Chorus)
So don't call me at 3am
Saying you need somebody, that you need a helping hand
需要一個人照顧, but I can't be that man
刪去的那些舊照片, yeah I deleted all the photos that we had
早已帶走我所有對你的感覺, took away the feelings, left the good with the bad
我就是不吃回頭草, I don't double back, no, that's not my style
So bye bye 願你幸福, go and find your happiness, it might take a while
There's no way that I'm coming back to you.

(Outro)
So don't call.
It's 3am.
Please don't call.
Let me go.

別知己 (Farewell)

(Verse 1)
The moon hangs cold in the sky, 月亮冷冷地挂在天上
It knows tomorrow is a long goodbye, 它也知道明天将是一场离别
So we light the fire, let the flames grow high, 我们升起火堆
Singing our songs underneath the starry guide, 唱起歌儿跳起舞来
A little bit of liquor to make us bold, 趁着酒意诉说
Spilling out our stories, the young and the old, 这一生的悲与喜
The joys and the sorrows, the whole damn ride.

(Verse 2)
Don't be so sentimental, my friend, 我的朋友你别再多愁善感
Yesterday is over, let the heartache end, 昨天已经过去
All the pain and the trouble, let it all transcend, 所有的伤心和烦恼已离去
Believe in tomorrow, a new day will ascend, 你要相信明天的天空
It's gonna be a bluer sky, 会更蔚蓝

(Chorus)
Yeah, so take it slow, my friend, take it slow
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (慢走)
Yeah, you gotta take it slow, my friend, you gotta go
Ne iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (你慢些走)
Take it slow, just take it slow
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (慢走)
My friend, my friend, take it slow before you go
Ngat qop bop iet ssa mu bbo (我的朋友你慢些走)

(Verse 3)
The night is sleeping, the stars are all sung out, 我们唱睡了黑夜唱睡了星辰
The sun is rising, there's no more room for doubt, 不知不觉地天就亮起来
You're stepping on that train, leaving this town, 在你踏上离别的火车 那一刻
And the tears are falling, I'm gonna drown, 我只顾着流泪
Forgot to wave my hand, forgot to make a sound, 忘了挥手忘了说再见
Just wishing you the best as the wheels go 'round, 望一路珍重
Yeah, wishing you the best as the wheels go 'round.

(Chorus)
Yeah, so take it slow, my friend, take it slow
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (慢走)
Yeah, you gotta take it slow, my friend, you gotta go
Ne iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (你慢些走)
Take it slow, just take it slow
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (慢走)
My friend, my friend, take it slow before you go
Ngat qop bop iet ssa mu bbo (我的朋友你慢些走)

(Outro)

I hope you're safe on your ride...

望一路珍重...

人間 (Human)

(Verse 1)
You try to be generous, you try to be kind, 哪怕事事都大度寬容
But the hurt never stops, it's a daily grind, 傷害又何曾停止
You try to be gentle, you try to hold it in, 哪怕事事都溫柔忍耐
But the sadness never lessens, where do you begin? 難過又何曾減少
You give your heart and soul, you give 'em everything you got, 善良的你掏心掏肺
But they just wanna see you fail, they want to see you rot, 想看你出醜的人卻太多
You're barely holding on, your own world is a mess, 你自己也不好過
But you're crying for their stories, you feel their stress, 卻要替別人的故事感動

(Chorus)
So I'm talking to the moon, yo, moon, don't you go to sleep, 月亮月亮你別睡
The lost ones are all drunk, their secrets hard to keep, 迷茫的人他已酒醉
The one I miss the most is gone, a promise they couldn't keep, 思念的人已經不在
Life is just a pile of worries, buried in the deep, 人生不過一堆堆的顧念
Oh moon, moon, don't you sleep, 月亮月亮你別睡
Help me get through these days, the climb is steep, 捱過這段艱難日子
When I look back on this, it'll all feel so cheap, 想起來也不過如此
I ain't drinking their fake liquor, I'm done with all the lies, 虛偽的酒我再也不接

(Bridge)
I'm done being the nice guy, the one who always bends
I'm done healing their wounds, just to lose in the end
This empathy's a prison, this kindness is a cage
Time to turn the page, get on a different stage
Maybe it's time to be selfish, time to be my own best friend
'Cause this road of giving everything just leads to a dead end.

(Chorus)
And I'm talking to the moon, yo, moon, don't you go to sleep, 月亮月亮你別睡
The lost ones are all drunk, their secrets hard to keep, 迷茫的人他已酒醉
The one I miss the most is gone, a promise they couldn't keep, 思念的人已經不在
Life is just a pile of worries, buried in the deep, 人生不過一堆堆的顧念
Oh moon, moon, don't you sleep, 月亮月亮你別睡
Help me get through these days, the climb is steep, 捱過這段艱難日子
When I look back on this, it'll all feel so cheap, 想起來也不過如此
I ain't drinking their fake liquor, I'm done with all the lies, 虛偽的酒我再也不接

(Outro)
Yeah... I'm done with the lies...
No more fake liquor...
Just me and the moon tonight...
不過人間...

萬水千山 (Miles Apart)

(Verse 1)
Another night, another town, another glass of wine
孤单的人心易碎, a lonely heart is a fragile design
未曾放下的人怕回忆, the ones who can't let go are scared of yesterday
So I keep moving, try to keep the ghosts at bay
Got my smokes and my liquor, that's my only crew, 我带上了烟酒四处流浪
Got nothing left to say to the world, me and you, we're through, 谁也没有开口说抱歉
But why you gotta fake a smile? 你何必假装快乐
And why've I gotta feel this pain for a while? 我何必真心难过
It's a silent conversation across the miles.

(Chorus)
I remember waiting for you, 我曾经等过你
'Cause I believed the words you said were true, 因为我也相信
You spoke of endless mountains, and a river flowing steady, 你说的万水千山细水长流
Now I can't love you anymore, my heart's already heavy, 如今不能再爱你
But I hope the sun will keep you safe and sound, 让暖阳护你周全
And if we meet again, on some other ground, 若再次的邂逅于人海
I'll still love you, yeah, 也还爱你

(Bridge)
Miles and miles of road behind me
Scars and memories, they still find me
Every city looks the same
When you're running from the flame
But your promise is a north star in the dark
A tiny spark, a permanent mark
Even though we're worlds apart.

(Chorus)
I remember waiting for you, 我曾经等过你
'Cause I believed the words you said were true, 因为我也相信
You spoke of endless mountains, and a river flowing steady, 你说的万水千山细水长流
Now I can't love you anymore, my heart's already heavy, 如今不能再爱你
But I hope the sun will keep you safe and sound, 让暖阳护你周全
And if we meet again, on some other ground, 若再次的邂逅于人海
I'll still love you, yeah, 也还爱你

(Outro)
If we meet again... in the crowded sea of life...
也还爱你...
I'll still love you...
Miles apart... but I'll still love you.

月亮 (Luna)

(Verse 1)
Young and reckless, that's the code we live by, 何人年少不轻狂
Raise a glass to the world as we pass on by, 酒杯一放在路上
Riding on a dream, that's my only horse, 以梦为马的远方
The air is full of fragrance and light, of course, 弥漫芬芳与光亮
Ain't nothing in my way, ain't nothing that can stop me, 沒有什麼能阻擋
Dry out the sorrow, let the confusion drop, see? 晒干悲伤和迷茫
Pushing through the dust and haze, the fog upon the sand, 穿過風沙和迷惘
'Til the setting sun is resting in the palm of my hand, 夕陽落在你肩上

(Pre-Chorus)
A body of proud bones between the earth and sky, 一身傲骨天地间
A hundred thousand dreams, man I'm flying high, 十万八千梦无边
The tears of yesterday are smoke, they disappear and die, 過往昨夜淚雲煙
At the peak of the white clouds, that's where my dreams all lie, 白雲深處夢之巔

(Chorus)
Oh, moon, moon, moon, won't you look at me now, 月亮月亮月亮你看看我
I made it through the lonely nights somehow, 熬過孤独和寂寞
And the wounds have bloomed into flowers of grace, 伤口盛开善意的花朵
Years from now, there'll be no trace of you and me in this place, 多年以後沒有你和我
Oh, moon, moon, moon, are you laughing at my game? 月亮月亮月亮你笑话我
I made it through the loneliness and shame, 熬過孤独和寂寞
And the wounds have bloomed into flowers so true, 伤口盛开善意的花朵
Only know how to give myself, what else can I do? 只懂默默奉獻着自我
Just me, a selfless fool.

(Outro)
Yeah, look at me now...
The wounds, they bloom...
Self-sacrifice... a cosmic joke...
自我...
The moon is watching.

無阻 (Unstoppable)

(Verse 1)
I'll give you my everything, that's the only way I know, 给你我的全部
You're the only bet I'm making, the only seed I'll grow, 你是我今生唯一的赌注
I'll leave behind a legacy of years, just for you to see, 只留下一段岁月

Scared you'll be alone or confused, I can't lie, 怕你孤单怕你糊涂

But I'll be there for you, to lighten up your load, 我可以朝朝暮暮

(Chorus)
Carrying the weight of yesterday, all the pain and all the strife, 提着昨日种种千辛万苦
To trade it for a better day, a brand new happy life, 向明天换一些美满和幸福
Do I love you enough, is my love good and true? 爱你够不够多, 对你够不够好
You can ask for anything, just don't be indifferent, boo, 可以要求不要不在乎

Just know that for you, I'll face the wind and tide, 是曾经无悔的风雨无阻
Unstoppable.

(Verse 2)
I'll give you a road to walk on, a path that's clear and bright, 给你一条我的路
I'll be the footsteps that are with you, day and night, 你是我一生不停的脚步
I'll build a sky above you, a world for you to own, 让我走出一片天空
So you can dance and chase your dreams, you'll never be alone, 让你尽情飞舞放心地追逐
Love is a long journey, a road that's full of turns, 爱是漫长的旅途
There will be joy, there will be pain, lessons that we'll learn, 梦有快乐梦有痛苦
This life is full of sorrow, and hellos and goodbyes, 悲欢离合人间路
But I can patch it up for you, I can mend the broken ties, 我可以缝缝补补

(Bridge)
Do I have enough? Is the dream good enough to hold? 拥有够不够多, 梦得够不够好
I'll keep on chasing, a story to be told, I'll never fold, 可以追求不认输
I'll take on any challenge, I'll take on any pain
Through the wind and the rain, again and again.

(Chorus)
Carrying the weight of yesterday, all the pain and all the strife, 提着昨日种种千辛万苦
To trade it for a better day, a brand new happy life, 向明天换一些美满和幸福
Do I love you enough, is my love good and true? 爱你够不够多, 对你够不够好
You can ask for anything, just don't be indifferent, boo, 可以要求不要不在乎

長大 (Grown Up)

(Verse 1)
一眼望盡的胡同, a dead-end street I used to know
聽慣習以為常的步履匆匆, the sound of rushing feet, the same old flow
巷口迎來送往的梧桐, the trees that watched us come and go
罩出一片笑語正濃, sheltering the laughter down below
走不出的小縣城, a small town that I couldn't escape
還遺留了古城牆上的響鐘, the old clock tower on the landscape
一聲傳滿了整片天空, its echo filled the sky, a mournful shape
充斥成年少的憂愁 和囚籠, filled with my youthful sorrow, my cage, my tape.

(Verse 2)
Was that the freedom you were dreaming of? 那是不是你渴望的自由
Thinking you could build your world with your own hands, with love? 以為理想靠雙手就足夠
Until reality gave you a shove, 直到被現實狠推一把
You fell and got covered in scars, from down below and up above, 跌到渾身是傷疤
And then you knew that life was not a fairy tale, my love, 才懂生活不是童話

(Chorus)
You're disappointed, ain't you? 你很失望吧
The world of adults ain't that fun, is it, boo? 大人的世界不快樂吧
Where did the smiling you go, the one you once knew? 那個愛笑的自己去哪了
Fighting with all your might just to be normal, just to get through, 拼盡全力掙扎 只為能成為普通人啊
You're tired, right? It's true, 你很累對嗎
Is this the grown-up life you always hoped for, is it you? 這是你期盼的長大嗎

(Bridge)
Did you let time just dry up all your dreams? 就任時光風乾夢想了嗎
Piled up a body full of scars, or so it seems, 堆積了一身傷疤
But you just smile and say nothing, whatever that redeems, 也只是笑笑不說話
You'll be happy in the end, you'll live it out, right? Or so you tell yourself at night.
還會幸福吧.

(Chorus)
You're disappointed, ain't you? 你很失望吧
The world of adults ain't that fun, is it, boo? 大人的世界不快樂吧
Where did the smiling you go, the one you once knew? 那個愛笑的自己去哪了
Fighting with all your might just to be normal, just to get through, 拼盡全力掙扎 只為能成為普通人啊
You're tired, right? It's true, 你很累對嗎
Is this the grown-up life you always hoped for, is it you? 這是你期盼的長大嗎

(Outro)
You'll be happy, right?
還會幸福吧...

起風了 (The Wind Rises)

(Verse 1)
这一路上走走停停, yeah, this road I walk, I stop and go
顺着少年漂流的痕迹, following the traces of a younger soul
迈出车站的前一刻, a moment 'fore I step out from the station slow
竟有些犹豫, a little hesitation, a feeling I don't know
不禁笑这近乡情怯, I gotta laugh, this feeling's kinda strange
仍无可避免, but it's a feeling that I can't exchange
而长野的天, and the sky of Nagano, it's still the same
依旧那么暖, still so warm, like a gentle flame
风吹起了从前, the wind is rising, blowing up the past.

(Chorus)
从前初识这世间, back when I first met this world, I was so keen
万般流连, a million things to love, a vibrant scene
看着天边似在眼前, the horizon felt so close, a waking dream
也甘愿赴汤蹈火去走它一遍, I'd have walked through fire just to see what I haven't seen
如今走过这世间, now I've walked this world, and I know its ways
万般流连, a million things to love, through all my days
翻过岁月不同侧脸, turning over pages, a different phase
措不及防闯入你的笑颜, but your smile still hits me in a sudden daze.

(Verse 2)
我曾难自拔于世界之大, I was lost inside a world I couldn't comprehend
也沉溺于其中梦话, and I was drowning in the dream talk of a friend
不得真假不做挣扎不惧笑话, didn't care what's real or fake, no need to struggle or defend
我曾将青春翻涌成她, I once turned my whole entire youth into her name
也曾指尖弹出盛夏, and from my fingertips, I played the summer's game
心之所动且就随缘去吧, whatever the heart wants, let it be, let it flow, let it claim
逆着光行走任风吹雨打, walking against the light, let the wind and rain just do its thing.

(Bridge)
The evening breeze blows through your hair, a touch of white and grey, 晚风吹起你鬓间的白发
It smooths the scars that memory has left along the way, 抚平回忆留下的疤
Your eyes are full of light and shade, a beautiful display, 你的眼中明暗交杂一笑生花
And in the twilight, I can see you start to fade, 暮色遮住你蹒跚的步伐
You walk into the painting that you hid beside the bed, 走进床头藏起的画
And in the painting, you are young, with a lowered head, 画中的你低着头说话

(Outro)
I still marvel at the world, so grand and so wide, 我仍感叹于世界之大
And I'm still drunk on the sweet nothings of a childhood tide, 也沉醉于儿时情话
No truth or lies, no struggle, no jokes to cast aside, 不剩真假不做挣扎无谓笑话
I finally gave my youth back to her, with nothing left to hide, 我终将青春还给了她
連同指尖彈出的盛夏, along with the summer that my fingertips set free
心之所動就隨風去了, whatever the heart wants, let the wind just take it from me.

黃花 (Self-Doubt)

(Skit: Sound of a tape recorder clicking on, soft room tone)

(Spoken)
Another night, another question...
Am I still lying to myself? 我是不是還對自己說謊啊
Just putting on a brave face for the world? 我是不是還故作堅定的生活啊
Am I still running from the person I'm supposed to be?
我是不是還不願承認我的天職啊

煮沸 (Cookin')

(Verse 1)
How should I act to look like I'm at ease? 該用怎樣的姿態才能看上去自在
Sometimes I just wanna hide, find some comfort, find some peace, 偶爾也想躲進舒適圈
Love is strange, I get it now, a beautiful disease, 愛情本來就奇怪不同頻率也精彩
Two different worlds, but we can still connect, we are the expertise, 不一樣宇宙的我們也能靠近

(Chorus)
Woo, first, gotta learn to love yourself, yeah, Woo 先學愛自己
Woo, then, share the thoughts you never tell, yeah, Woo 再共享心事
Woo, slowly get used to this two-person world, we're raisin' hell, yeah, Woo 慢慢去適應兩人世界
You opened up my taste buds, taught me bitter, spicy, sweet, 你陪我打開味蕾教會我苦辣酸甜
Taught me how to heal my wounds, accept my own defeat, 學會和自己和解療傷也需要時間
It's okay, it's okay, let's turn up the heat, 一點點讓生活煮沸
Eheh, a little sweet, a little salt, that's the taste of all the years, yeah, 有甜咸那才稱得上歲月

(Verse 2)
I love your weirdness, it makes me focus, makes me whole, 妳的奇怪我都喜歡讓我全神贯注即便失控
My heart's a black hole, ready to swallow up your soul, 心是黑洞可以包容万物
Hit the pause button, baby, let's just lose control, 按下暫停鍵來陪妳跳支舞
Let my tongue just wander, your smile's the best seasoning I've known, 舌尖漫步妳的笑容就是最好調味
Soul jazz vibe, déjà vu, feel it in my bones
Maybe we're in different time zones, but I feel you on the phone, Maybe身處不同的时空面对自己的感受
Learn to let go of some things, wait for you to come along, 學會放下一些等妳靠近我们一起走
We're cooking all day long, a gentle kind of strong, 相互配合的温柔
Serving up the perfect vibe, this is where we belong, 端出那最完美的感動

(Bridge)
In the spring, we watch the shy flowers bloom (You know about that)
In the summer, I'll go on adventures with you (我陪你冒險)
In the autumn, we'll wander through the falling leaves (兩人世界徘徊)
In the winter, you're the one that warms me up with ease (Yeah You know we're cooking cooking all along)

替我 (For Me)

(Verse 1)
They wanna run from me, yeah, they wanna escape, 他們想往外逃
I don't care anymore, it's just the shape that I take, 而我早已無所謂
Maybe the world forgot my name, forgot my face, 可能这个世界已经忘记我是谁
I don't wanna be a demon, so just run away, I don't wanna be a demon when u see me run away
It feels like from the start, we were destined to be back to back, 好像从一开始注定我们背对背
Who falls in love with who? Who feels the guilt from the attack? 谁会爱上谁 谁又让谁内疚
The happy people in the city watch the fireworks crack, 这座城市幸福的人在欣赏着烟火
And then you found me, like an angel on the track, 而找到我的你 像拯救我的angle
Tryna pull me from the vortex, from the black, 试图将我拉出这个封印我的漩涡

(Verse 2)
But I can't forget the tears that I saw in your eyes, 始终忘不了你的泪光
I don't deserve you, all I do is make you cry, 我配不上却让你悲伤
Like crystals buried deep, a sad surprise, 一颗颗水晶埋进了眼眶
You lit up my cold, dark night, you were my sunrise, 冰冷的黑夜都被点亮
You said you felt my pain, the罪I have to bear, 你说你心疼我受的罪
Told me to believe in beauty after the storm, the clean air, 让我去相信风雨后的美
But how do I piece together this shattered affair? 可如何去拼凑这支离破碎
I lost my hope for the future, I just don't care, 我早已对未来失去了憧憬
I feel so lonely, yeah, 我感觉lonely
Watching the world on my phone, it's the only view I see, 在手机上看外面风景
Vision's blurry, double vision, what's wrong with me? 怎么会视线有重影
Can't escape the dark clouds that hang over me, 怎么躲不开头顶的乌云

(Chorus)
You better run, better run, better run, yeah
趁你纯白的衣裳还没被弄脏, 'fore your pure white clothes get stained by my pain
I hate myself for being this way, it's insane, 我自己都恨我自己这样
I push 'em all away, can't open up this window for the rain, 推开所有人却推不开心里的窗
So go and see the world's beauty, in my place, 替我去看看这世界的美丽
Breathe the freshest air for me, win the human race, 替我去呼吸最新鲜的空气
Be brave for me, be free for me, please, just in case, 替我去勇敢替我自由
I can't make it out of this place.

(Outro)

替我自由...
Breathe for me...
替我...
Live for me...

驕傲 (Scars)

(Verse 1)
Scared to run away, scared to be left behind, 害怕逃開不再被誰期待
Scared if I fail, who will be by my side? 如果失敗是誰會先離開

I'll get there, I'll get there, I know I'm coming, yeah, 會到啊到啊
And all these wounds will turn to scars, that's something, yeah, 傷口總會結成結痂

But our flaws are the fireworks that light up the night, 而缺陷是最燦爛的煙花

(Bridge)
Let me fall, I'll get up again
Let the scars write the story of where I've been
This ain't a sign of weakness, it's a sign I fought
A testament to every single lesson I was taught
So I wear them with pride, for all the world to see
This is me.

These are my scars...

沒有你 (No You)

(Verse 1)

Freezing in this moment of endless pain, 凍結的瞬間
The wind blows through this winter without you, baby, 風吹過沒有你的冬天
The whole world is cold and piercing, it's driving me crazy, 原來整個世界都冰冷的刺眼
The window's crying with me, the tears all look the same, 玻璃窗也哭花了臉陪著我重溫一遍
Guess you told me that your love had a time limit, what a shame, 原來你說的愛設定了期限

(Verse 2)
I'm counting the days without you, trying to survive the night, 我數著沒有你的時間熬過每個黑夜
Still can't learn to say goodbye, it doesn't feel right, 學不會告別

I don't have the right to call your number anymore, 再沒資格撥通你電話

(Chorus)
It's a pity I couldn't be your white horse, a prince for you to claim, 只可惜沒能成為你的白馬
Couldn't get down on one knee, in front of all the flashing flames, 沒能單膝跪下

Now that I've lost your favor, I finally understand the game, 失去你的偏愛現在我才明白

(Bridge)
Can't find you! 找不到! I can't find you! 找不到!
Where'd you go? 找不到! I'm gonna find you! 找不到!
I'm looking! 找不到! I'm looking! 找不到!
Can't find you! 找不到! Can't find you! 找不到!
I found you. 找到了. I found you. 找到了.
There you are. 找到了. I found you. 找到了.
I found you. 找到了. I found you. 找到了.
Found you. 找到了. Found you. 找到了.

(Chorus)
And the sound my heart makes is...
咚咚 (Dong Dong), 咚咚 (Dong Dong)
咚咚 (Dong Dong), 咚咚 (Dong Dong)
Yeah, my heart goes...
咚咚 (Dong Dong), 咚咚 (Dong Dong)
咚咚 (Dong Dong), 咚咚 (Dong Dong)

此刻 (This Moment)

(Verse 1)
Writing long letters for relationships that are short, 寫很長的信紀念很短的關係
Using a poet's pen, a photographer's eye, a work of art, 用詩人的筆攝影師的眼睛
I'm used to digging through their fickle hearts like an archeologist, 太習慣考古他們善變的心
But sometimes I just wanna be a ruin that nobody's ever missed, 偶爾也想當個熱門的廢墟

(Pre-Chorus)
About the way that people come and go, 關於人與人來來去去
About the way that people walk and stop, the ebb and flow, 關於人與人走走停停

(Chorus)
We probably only have this moment, you and I, 我們大概只有現在
A secret evening with the city lights nearby, 秘密的夜晚燈火闌珊
Sadness is so hard, and happiness just flies, 難過很難快樂很快
Especially when you're on the other side of the sky, 當你不在雲的另一端
Maybe fate is just a fool that doesn't know its place, 緣份命運不知好歹
But for this single moment, you're the love of my whole life's space, 只在此刻的畢生摯愛

(Verse 2)
Walking a long road to act out a movie that's too fast, 走很長的路演很短的電影
Two coffee cups, one blurry reflection in the glass, 兩個咖啡杯一個模糊倒影
I'm used to rehearsing all the scenes of saying our goodbyes, 太習慣預演他們告別的場景
Until the whole damn city is a graveyard for our ties, 直到整座城市都是親吻的墓地

(Pre-Chorus)
About the way that people come and go, 關於人與人來來去去
About the way that people walk and stop, the ebb and flow, 關於人與人走走停停

(Bridge)
It's all part of the best arrangement, a cosmic design, 都是最好安排
The next stop is unknown, but I know it will be fine, 未知的下一站
A sun-drenched coast is waiting, a future so divine, 陽光灑落的海岸

(Outro)
We still have so many moments, you and I, 我們還有很多現在
Just for this moment, you're the love of my whole life, 只在此刻的畢生摯愛
Yeah, just for this moment... the love of my life.
