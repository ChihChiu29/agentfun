Style 1: Lofi Hip Hop/Chillhop

A melancholic and nostalgic lofi hip hop track. The beat should be slow and hazy, with a prominent, mellow bassline and a simple, repetitive drum pattern (e.g., a boom-bap beat with a soft kick and snare). The melody should be played on a Rhodes-style electric piano, with a warm, slightly distorted sound. Add some subtle vinyl crackle and ambient city sounds (e.g., distant sirens, rain) to create a sense of intimacy and isolation. The overall mood should be introspective, rainy-day vibes, perfect for late-night listening.

Style 2: Trap/Emo Rap

A dark and emotional trap beat with emo rap influences. The drums should be heavy and hard-hitting, with a deep 808 bass, rapid-fire hi-hats, and a sharp, syncopated snare. The melody should be a simple, haunting piano or synth line, with a melancholic and slightly eerie feel. The vocals should be delivered with a mix of melodic rapping and emotional, almost-screamed ad-libs. The overall mood should be raw, desperate, and full of angst, capturing the pain of heartbreak and betrayal.

Style 3: Synthwave/Retrowave

A retro-futuristic synthwave track with a strong 80s influence. The beat should be driving and danceable, with a classic gated reverb snare and a pulsating synth bassline. The melody should be played on a bright, shimmering synth lead, with arpeggiated synth pads creating a sense of atmosphere and nostalgia. The vocals should be delivered with a smooth, reverb-drenched quality. The overall mood should be stylish, cinematic, and full of neon-soaked melancholy, like the soundtrack to a stylish 80s thriller.

Style 4: Acoustic/Folk

A stripped-down and intimate acoustic version of the song. The primary instrument should be a single acoustic guitar, fingerpicked with a gentle, melancholic melody. The vocals should be raw, emotional, and very present, with a sense of vulnerability and honesty. Add some subtle, atmospheric elements like a soft string pad or a distant, mournful cello line to enhance the emotional weight of the song. The overall mood should be quiet, introspective, and heartbreakingly beautiful, like a private confession whispered in the dark.

---

Style 5: Cinematic/Orchestral

A grand and dramatic orchestral arrangement of the song. The music should build from a simple, melancholic piano intro to a sweeping, full-orchestra crescendo. Use a combination of strings, brass, and woodwinds to create a rich, textured soundscape. The vocals should be powerful and emotive, soaring over the orchestra. The overall mood should be epic, tragic, and deeply moving, like the score to a heartbreaking film. The music should convey a sense of loss, longing, and the vastness of the city.
