A Chinese hip-hop track with a dark, introspective, and poetic vibe. The lyrics blend Mandarin Chinese with English, exploring themes of loneliness, perseverance, and self-belief in a cold, unforgiving urban environment. The flow should be smooth and melancholic, with a touch of defiance. The beat should be a classic boom-bap style with a modern twist, featuring a prominent bassline, a slow to medium tempo, and atmospheric elements like synth pads or samples of city sounds. The overall mood is one of moody contemplation, with a glimmer of hope and determination.
