Reckless

(Verse 1)
Been through the storm, yeah, the wind and the rain
Seen all the highs and the lows, felt the pleasure and pain
You were the calm in the eye, quiet and true
Lookin' up at the stars, yeah, that's just how you do
Readin' your eyes, man, I see it all clear
This broken world ain't a place for your fears
You walk your own path, through the darkness and doubt
Fate brought us together, let me spell it all out

(Pre-Chorus)
Every single doubt you held inside your soul
I'm here to prove 'em wrong, make you finally whole

(Chorus)
Yeah, for you, for you, I'll be reckless and bold
Let the world tell me I'm wrong, a story to be told
One day this all will be a memory, a past design
Every storm we ever faced, a beautiful skyline
Yeah, for you, for you, I'll be reckless and brave
Against the current, against the grain, the love I save
Even if the whole damn world becomes my enemy line
I won't regret this love for you, truly, fully mine.

(Verse 2)
This world is in pieces, torn up at the seams
But for you I'll stitch it back, live out all your dreams
This fire we got now, this passionate blaze
Will be the small moments we remember for days
Wanna be the solid ground, shatter all the shade
Melt it down to flawless glass, a brand new light is made
Even if I lose it all, break every single rule
Like a renegade wing, man, I'm breakin' from the school

(Chorus)
Yeah, for you, for you, I'll be reckless and bold
Let the world tell me I'm wrong, a story to be told
One day this all will be a memory, a past design
Every storm we ever faced, a beautiful skyline
Yeah, for you, for you, I'll be reckless and brave
Against the current, against the grain, the love I save
Even if the whole damn world becomes my enemy line
I won't regret this love for you, truly, fully mine.

(Outro)
Holdin' you, standin' by you
Yeah, I even loved your reckless side too.

All These Years

(Verse 1)
The simple days, walkin' side by side, the way you used to smile
That's the future I was seein', stayin' for a while
Back then, the time we shared, hallways in the school
Felt like we were crazy, breakin' every rule
Now I can't be nothin' to you, just a ghost in your past
Do you ever, even for a second, wish that we could last?

(Chorus)
All these years, wishin' that my dreams came true
All these years, standin' right here next to you
Don't wanna flip through photos, turnin' memories to dust
Rememberin' the moments, buildin' up the trust
All these years, wishin' all the dreams were real
All these years, hopin' that the promise I could feel
Why am I still stuck inside this moment, lost in time?
I remember we existed, a love that was sublime.

(Verse 2)
The sunsets that we missed, do they even count as ours?
Now this moment's all I have, countin' down the hours
That day, chasin' the heavy rain, felt like I was gonna drown
Left me here to save myself, in this lonely town
Now I can't be nothin' to you, just a face in the crowd
Do you ever, even for a second, say my name out loud?

(Chorus)
All these years, wishin' that my dreams came true
All these years, standin' right here next to you
Don't wanna flip through photos, turnin' memories to dust
Rememberin' the moments, buildin' up the trust
All these years, wishin' all the dreams were real
All these years, hopin' that the promise I could feel
Why am I still stuck inside this moment, lost in time?
I remember we existed, a love that was sublime.

(Bridge)
Was it my fault? Was it all on me?
Why'd you turn your back that day, refuse to see?
Do you have any idea how I made it through alone?
All this time, on my own, sittin' by the phone.

(Chorus)
All these years, wishin' that my dreams came true
All these years, standin' right here next to you
Don't wanna flip through photos, turnin' memories to dust
Rememberin' a love that was, buildin' up the trust
All these years, wishin' all the dreams were real
All these years, hopin' that the promise I could feel
Why am I still stuck inside this moment, lost in time?
Don't you dare forget that your love was once mine.
Yeah, don't forget we existed.

The One on My Left

(Verse 1)
Before you, yo, my world was a mess
Full of thorns and deep abysses, gotta confess
Didn't know someone could catch me with a gentle hand
My whole world was 'bout to crumble, couldn't understand

(Chorus)
The one on my left, still standin' right there
Protects me from the tears, shows me that he cares
He said "May you never sink into the dark again"
"You're a star yourself," my friend, my ride or die 'til the end
The one on my left, he's always on my side
Doesn't matter if it's darkness or the morning tide
He'll always give me a light, no conditions, no debate
A beacon in the night, changin' my whole fate.

(Verse 2)
After you, the world I'm in now, it's a different place
A garden full of warmth, left without a trace
Of the coldness from before, gotta thank you for your grace
For bein' patient with me, an imperfect, flawed case

(Chorus)
The one on my left, still standin' right there
Protects me from the tears, shows me that he cares
He said "May you never sink into the dark again"
"You're a star yourself," my friend, my ride or die 'til the end
The one on my left, he's always on my side
Doesn't matter if it's darkness or the morning tide
He'll always give me a light, no conditions, no debate
A beacon in the night, changin' my whole fate.

(Bridge)
The one on my left, still standin' right here
Wanna seal up all the joy, make it crystal clear
Not afraid to face the wind and rain, the dust of the years
As long as you are with me, conquerin' all my fears
The one on my left, hopin' you can keep that simple heart
Hope the world doesn't betray the way you played your part
Yeah, the world better not betray your reckless, lovin' heart.

What Am I

(Verse 1)
How'd your kindness get a sharp and painful edge?
How'd your greetings leave me on a lonely ledge?
You say I'm not as carefree as I was before
But behind the question, you're halfway out the door

(Pre-Chorus)
Please, if the pain's gotta be carved out with a knife
If these feelings can't be honest, what's this life?
If "us" is just an "if", a maybe, a goodbye...
Then tell me what's the reason, tell me why

(Chorus)
So what am I to you? Really, tell me now
If you want me gone, one shot is all you're allowed
Don't hesitate, just aim it at the wound, you see
So what am I to you? Just say the words to me
Please just spit it out, don't leave me in suspense
I don't need it clean, I don't need no false pretense

(Verse 2)
So your tenderness was just a way to be free
Your "how you been?" became your own release, I see
Yeah, I get it now, if sorrow's a design
If feelings can't be real, if they're never truly mine
If "us" is just an "if," a story left to die...

(Chorus)
So what am I to you? Really, tell me now
If you want me gone, one shot is all you're allowed
Don't hesitate, just aim it at the wound, you see
So what am I to you? Just say the words to me
Please just spit it out, don't leave me in suspense
I don't need it clean, I don't need no false pretense

(Bridge)
I already get it, yeah I understand
It's all my own doing, a fool in quicksand
My hands are for holding me, keepin' me from the fall
Your hands, I'm beggin' you, just use them to end it all
Aim for the wound...

(Outro)
So what am I?
If you want me gone, one shot and I'll comply
No more talk, just aim it at the sore
What am I?
Spit it out, don't hang me anymore
I don't need it clean, just show me to the door.

Seas I've Never Seen

(Verse 1)
Alarm clock rings this morning, a hit right to my soul
Same old turning over, a reminder I'm not whole
The light through the window, a hazy, shifting state
Is a memory that won't leave, a love that turned to hate
So I let the hangover win, yeah, I let it seal my fate

(Verse 2)
The streetlights burn tonight, a warm and whispered word
My gaze lands on a future, a past I've overheard
Winter's coming, feel the chill, blame the fickle sky
But my heart keeps screaming your name, I can't deny
Your eyes, my destiny, the reason I get by

(Chorus)
Seas I've never seen before, now they're in your eyes
Crashing on a lonely shore, then turn to tears I cry
Seas I've never seen before, if heaven and earth just fade away
Sorrow, joy, side by side, I'll love them all, night and day

(Bridge)
The world's desire burns my peace, leaves a nasty scar
But the voice inside my head, that's you, a distant star
Is life about the chase or is it listening to fate?
If I stay awake all night, it's cause my love for you is great
Yeah, I'm mesmerized by you, can't set the record straight

(Chorus)
Seas I've never seen before, now they're in your eyes
Crashing on a lonely shore, then turn to tears I cry
Seas I've never seen before, 'til heaven and earth just fade away
Sorrow, joy, side by side, I'll love them all, night and day

(Outro)
Seas I've never seen before, reflectin' in our gaze
All the fate and blank regrets, become the tears that stream my face
Seas I've never seen before, 'midst fading smoke and sky
Sorrow, joy, together now, tell us not to wait, but fly.

White Night

(Verse 1)
You got something to say, don't you? Yeah, I feel the air
The silence gets so loud, man, it's more than I can bear
Then you stroke my cheek so gently, a confusing, soft caress
Like a flower grown in darkness, this love's a tangled mess
How can I ignore it? My heart just took a hit, gotta confess

(Verse 2)
Your kindness is more terrifying than showing me your pain
The questions get all blurry, a mix of sun and rain
You're holding on to treasure while you're lettin' it all go
You take 'em both, you drop 'em both, a poison, movin' slow
Do you love me, do you not? You got an answer for it all, I know

(Chorus)
I'd rather you just say it, look me in the eye and say "no"
Don't let me think there's a way out at the end of this dead road
Don't pretend that at the end of all despair there's a new light
A lie that's painted white is still a lie that blocks the sight
The kinder that your love is, the easier I'll let it go, goodnight.

(Verse 3)
A slow cut is more brutal than a messy, bloody fight
Your questions stay all blurry, what is wrong and what is right
A mix of hate and loving, a tangled, bitter thread
You take 'em both, you drop 'em both, the living and the dead
Do you want me, do you not? The words are better left unsaid.

(Chorus)
I'd rather you just say it, look me in the eye and say "no"
Don't let me think my lucky streak ain't over, nowhere to go
Don't pretend that at the end of all despair there's a new light
A lie that's painted white is still a lie that blocks the sight
The safer that your love feels, the more I'm terrified all night.

(Outro)
I'd rather you just say it, look me in the eye and say "no"
Don't let me get my hopes up, watchin' a forbidden show
Don't pretend that at the end of all despair there's a new light
The sun inside a white night ain't the moon, it isn't right
A lingering, false brightness, a beautiful and empty sight.
Like a white night sun, right?
Your dawn is also twilight.
Same gold, same tragic light.

I Will Wait

(Verse 1)
Wanna learn a magic spell to fly through outer space
Plant a universe of wishes, leave 'em without a trace
Watch 'em grow among the stars while I'm dreamin' in my bed
Even the wind don't know where it's supposed to be led
And the fallen leaves must miss their homes, the words they never said
I learned to wipe my tears away, pretend it's sweat instead

(Chorus)
I'mma wait for the dead tree to sprout a new design
Wait for the sun to pierce the dark, that first morning line
I'mma wait for a downpour to wash the past away
So I can see the world with you and seize a brand new day
I'mma wait for the winter snow to melt in summer's fan
Watch the stars at midnight blink, according to the plan
I'mma wait for the you in the story, tell a joke and make me smile
Believin' you and good dreams will arrive in just a while

(Verse 2)
Wanna learn a magic spell to write the future scenes
Put 'em all down on the paper, live beyond my means
Thought of the perfect answer, what I was gonna say
Even the rain don't know when it's gonna stop today
And the strongest people miss their homes when they are far away
I learned to wipe my tears away, pretend it's sweat instead

(Chorus)
I'mma wait for the dead tree to sprout a new design
Wait for the sun to pierce the dark, that first morning line
I'mma wait for a downpour to wash the past away
So I can see the world with you and seize a brand new day
I'mma wait for the winter snow to melt in summer's fan
Watch the stars at midnight blink, according to the plan
I'mma wait for the you in the story, tell a joke and make me smile
Believin' you and good dreams will arrive in just a while

(Outro)
I'mma wait for the dead tree to sprout a new design
Wait for the sun to pierce the dark, that first morning line
I'mma wait for a downpour to wash the past away

I'mma wait for the winter snow to melt in summer's fan
Watch the stars at midnight blink, according to the plan
I'mma wait for the you in the story, tell a joke and make me smile
Believin' you and good dreams will arrive... yeah, they'll arrive in just a while.

Wish List

(Verse 1)
Yeah, there's places on my list that I'll never get to see
But I wrote 'em down regardless, for you and for me
I see other people goin', feelin' that envy brew
Like, why the hell can they go? And why can't me and you?
I saw those spots and knew that you would love the view
So I saved 'em on the low, nothin' else to do
Spendin' a few days and nights, what's the big deal in the end?
I don't wanna use "fate" as an excuse again, my friend
Slowly, all the fake things start to feel real when they blend

(Chorus)
Everything on my wish list, I thought that it could be
Crossin' off the dreams I finished, one, by two, by three
In the end, the only thing that's left on it is you
Yeah, the final box to check, the only dream that's true

(Verse 2)
I saw those spots and knew right then, "yo, that's a place for her"
So I saved 'em in my phone, a silent, hopeful stir
A couple nights away from home, how hard could that be, right?
I refuse to let my life be explained by fate's dim light
Slowly, the illusion starts to feel so real and bright

(Chorus)
Everything on my wish list, I thought that it could be
Crossin' off the dreams I finished, one, by two, by three
In the end, the only thing that's left on it is you
Even if it's all a lie, I'm gonna see it through

(Outro)
The names up in my pocket, they're still sittin' there, undone
That's when I learned a wish just means a battle never won
And you, of all the wishes, are the hardest one to land
Sometimes the memory ain't the trip, you gotta understand
It's the person who's not with you when you finally make a stand.

3am

(Verse 1)
Yo, don't call me at 3am
Saying you need somebody, you need a helping hand
Deleted all them old photos, erased 'em from my mind
Took away my feelings, left that love behind
I don't go back for seconds, so bye bye, wish you the best
There's no way that I'm coming back, put it to the test

(Verse 2)
The day we broke up at the amusement park gate
Tried to talk some sense, but your tears sealed our fate
Couldn't keep the promise of you stayin' by my side
Stupid me for thinking that our love had no deadline
I don't wanna pick up my phone, keep lyin' to myself
That the story had a happy end, put the book back on the shelf
Tryna fix this? It's like shootin' for the moon
But the ball is still right here, ending way too soon
Shattered memories, let 'em fade to black, turn transparent and clear

(Chorus)
So don't call me at 3am
Saying you need somebody, you need a helping hand
Deleted all them old photos, erased 'em from my mind
Took away my feelings, left that love behind
I don't go back for seconds, so bye bye, wish you the best
There's no way that I'm coming back to you, I confess

(Bridge)
Back to being strangers now, it's a cold reality
Feelings start to fade away, no more misery
My only fault is keepin' you alive inside my songs
Time to turn the page and right my own life's wrongs

(Chorus)
So don't call me at 3am
Saying you need somebody, you need a helping hand
Deleted all them old photos, erased 'em from my mind
Took away my feelings, left that love behind
I don't go back for seconds, so bye bye, wish you the best
There's no way that I'm coming back to you, I confess

Farewell, My Friend

(Verse 1)
The moon is hangin' cold and high up in the sky
It knows tomorrow means we're gonna say goodbye
We build a fire, sing our songs, we dance until the dawn
Drunk on wine and honesty, from dusk until the morn'
We talk about the joys and pains of a life that's come and gone

(Verse 2)
Oh moon, don't be so gentle, don't you fill the night with grace
And my friend, don't be so sentimental, wipe that sorrow from your face
Yesterday is over, all the hurt and all the dread
You gotta trust the sky tomorrow will be bluer up ahead

(Chorus)
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (Take it slow)
Ne iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (You take it slow)
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (Take it slow)
Ngat qop bop iet ssa mu bbo (My friend, you take it slow)

(Bridge)
The sun comes up without a warning, night begins to fade
We sang the darkness and the stars to sleep, a serenade
The moment that you stepped onto that train to leave this place
I was only crying, tears were streaming down my face
Forgot to wave, forgot to say "goodbye," just stood there in a daze
Hope your journey's safe and sound in countless different ways.

(Chorus)
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (Take it slow)
Ne iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (You take it slow)
Iet ssa iet ssa mu bbo (Take it slow)
Ngat qop bop iet ssa mu bbo (My friend, you take it slow)

(Outro)
The moment that you stepped onto that train to leave this place
I was only crying, tears were streaming down my face
Forgot to wave, forgot to say "goodbye"
Hope you're safe along the way
Forgot to wave, forgot to say "goodbye"
Hope you're safe along the way
Forgot to wave, forgot to say "goodbye"
Hope you're safe along the way.

Just Human

(Verse 1)
Even if you're generous, give 'em all your soul
The hurt just never stops, it always takes its toll
Even if you're gentle, patient, and you play your part
The sadness never lessens, it just tears you all apart
You got a good heart, give your best, you're always kind and true
But too many people out there wanna see the fool in you
You ain't doin' so well yourself, your own life's a mess
But you're cryin' for their stories, feelin' all their stress

(Chorus)
Oh moon, oh moon, don't go to sleep tonight
The lost ones, they've been drinkin', gettin' faded in the light
The one they miss is gone now, a ghost inside their head
Life is just a pile of duties, words we left unsaid
Oh moon, oh moon, don't go to sleep, just get through this hard time
When you look back, it's nothing, just a hill you had to climb
I'm never takin' that fake poison, that phony cup of wine.

(Verse 2)
Even if you're generous, you open up your heart
The pain just never quits, it's been there from the start
Even if you're gentle, you endure it with a smile
The sorrow never shrinks, it just stays with you a while
You got a good heart, give your best, you're always kind and true
But too many people out there wanna make a fool of you
You ain't doin' so well yourself, your own life's a mess
But you're cryin' for their stories, caught up in their stress

(Chorus)
Oh moon, oh moon, don't go to sleep tonight
The lost ones, they've been drinkin', gettin' faded in the light
The one they miss is gone now, a ghost inside their head
Life is just a pile of duties, words we left unsaid
Oh moon, oh moon, don't go to sleep, just get through this hard time
When you look back, it's nothing, just a hill you had to climb
I'm never takin' that fake poison, that phony cup of wine.

(Outro)
Oh moon, oh moon, don't go to sleep, the lost ones are all drunk tonight
The one they miss is gone now, faded from their sight
Life is just a pile of duties, words we should have said
Oh moon, oh moon, don't go to sleep, just get through this instead
When you look back, it's nothing, just a hill you had to climb
I'm never takin' that fake poison, not another time.
Yeah, look back and it's nothing, never takin' that fake wine.

Your World Away

(Verse 1)
A lonely heart is fragile, shatters like some glass
People holdin' on to somethin', they're afraid of the past
I got used to the loneliness, tangled in its thread
Lettin' midnight tears just flow, a river in my head
They wander, lost and aimless, from the things that you once said

(Bridge)
Why you gotta fake your joy? Put on a happy show?
Why I gotta feel this pain? A truth I'll never know
Nobody ever said the word, nobody said "I'm sorry"
So I hit the road with liquor, to forget my blurry story

(Chorus)
Yeah, I used to wait for you, I really did, you know
'Cause I believed the words you said, a "watch our love grow"
"A thousand mountains, a million streams," a promise soft and low
Now I can't love you anymore, I gotta let you go
Let the warm sun keep you safe, protect you from the cold
If we ever meet again, in a crowd of young and old
I'd still love you, that's the truth that can't be bought or sold.

(Bridge 2)
So why you gotta fake your joy? And hide what you've become?
And why I gotta feel this pain? So bitter and so numb.
Nobody ever said a word, no apology was made
Just me, the bottle, and the road, a lonely masquerade

(Chorus)
Yeah, I used to wait for you, I really did, you know
'Cause I believed the words you said, a "watch our love grow"
"A thousand mountains, a million streams," a promise soft and low
Now I can't love you anymore, I gotta let you go
Let the warm sun keep you safe, protect you from the cold
If we ever meet again, in a crowd of young and old
I'd still love you, that's the truth that can't be bought or sold.

(Outro)
Yeah, I used to wait for you, I believed it was true
The world of rivers, mountains, everything you said you'd do
Now I can't love you anymore, just let the warmth shine on
And if I see you in the crowd before my time is gone...
I'd still love you.
Yeah, if I see you in the crowd... I'd still love you.

The Moon is Watching

(Verse 1)
Who ain't reckless when they're young and full of pride?
Drop the cup and hit the road, with nowhere left to hide
Chasin' dreams on horseback, to a future far away
Full of fragrance and of light, at the closing of the day
Ain't nothin' that can stop me now, no reason left to stay
Dry the sadness and confusion, wash the doubt away
Through the wind and sand and haze, I'm fightin' through the fray
The setting sun is on your shoulders, listen what I say

(Bridge)
A body full of pride, standin' tall between the earth and sky
A hundred thousand dreams unbound, I'm soaring way up high
The past is tears and cloudy smoke, a memory passin' by
Above the clouds is where I'll land, the peak where eagles fly

(Chorus)
Oh moon, oh moon, oh moon, you see me now
I made it through the lonely nights, I kept my sacred vow
The wounds have bloomed with flowers of a kindness I have grown
After all these years, it's just me, standing here alone

(Chorus 2)
Oh moon, oh moon, oh moon, you laugh at me
I made it through the lonely nights, for everyone to see
The wounds have bloomed with flowers of a kindness I have sown
Just know how to give myself, a quiet, steady drone.
Myself. Alone.

Come What May

(Verse 1)
I give you all I have, my everything, my soul
You're the only bet I'm making, trying to be whole
Just left with these few years, a chapter in my book
For a love without regrets, whatever path I took
Scared you'll be sad, scared you'll cry your tears
Scared you'll be alone, lost in all your fears
This world's a thousand mountains, a long and winding road
But I can be there day and night, to help you with your load

(Verse 2)
I'll give you my own path, a road for you to walk
You're the endless steps I take, the reason that I talk
Let me build a brand new sky, a world for you to own
So you can dance and fly so free, a queen upon a throne
Love's a long, long journey, a never-ending quest
Dreams have joy and dreams have pain, they put you to the test
Joy and sorrow, life and death, the way the story's paved
But I can stitch it all together, make sure that you're saved

(Chorus)
Carrying the weight of yesterday, the struggle and the pain
Trading it for a tomorrow full of sun and not of rain
Do I love you quite enough? Am I good enough for you?
You can ask for more, just please don't say that we are through
I don't want you to see my scars, the wounds I hide inside
That's the storm I faced for you, with nothing left to hide.
Come what may, I'm by your side.

(Outro)
Is what I have enough? Are my dreams good and true?
I can keep on fighting for them, I will not lose for you.

Is This Growing Up?

(Verse 1)
A dead-end alley, that's the world I see
Hear the same old hurried footsteps, rushing to be free
The trees there at the entrance, they welcome and they send
Away the smiling faces, 'til the laughter has to end

(Verse 2)
A small town I can't escape from, a tiny little cage
Still hear the bell from the old city wall, turning a new page
One sound fills up the whole sky, a deep and mournful tone
Full of teenage melancholy, a feeling I have known
A prison that I call my own

(Pre-Chorus)
Was that the freedom you were dreaming of? The world you hoped to find?
Thinking you could build your future, leave the past behind
'Til reality pushed you hard and sent you to the ground
Covered you in scars and wounds, without a single sound
That's when you learn that life is not a fairy tale you've found

(Chorus)
You're disappointed, aren't you? This grown-up world's a bore
The part of you that used to laugh, it isn't there no more
You fight with all your energy, you struggle and you bleed
Just to be a normal person, planting a new seed
You're tired, aren't you? It's true, right?
Is this the life you hoped for, in the darkness of the night?
You let your dreams get weathered by the wind and by the sun
A body full of scars to show, for battles fought and won
You just smile and say nothing, but you'll be happy, when it's done.
Right?

(Interlude)
Yeah, you'll find happiness someday... right?

(Chorus)
You're disappointed, aren't you? This grown-up world's a bore
The part of you that used to laugh, it isn't there no more
You fight with all your energy, you struggle and you bleed
Just to be a normal person, planting a new seed
You're tired, aren't you? It's true, right?
Is this the life you hoped for, in the darkness of the night?
You let your dreams get weathered by the wind and by the sun
A body full of scars to show, for battles fought and won
You just smile and say nothing, but you'll be happy, when it's done.

The Wind Rises

(Verse 1)
On this road I walk and stop, a journey without end
Following the traces of a long-lost, youthful friend
The moment I stepped from the station, a pause within my soul
A hesitation taking over, losing all control
I had to laugh, this coming home, this fear I can't escape
The sky of Nagano is still warm, a familiar, gentle shape
And the wind blows up the past...

(Pre-Chorus)
Back when I first knew this world, a thousand things to see
Everything I longed for, right in front of me
I was willing to go through the fire, walk that path again and again
Now I've walked through this world, felt its pleasure and its pain
Flipping through the years, the faces, see them in the rain
And suddenly I crash into your smiling face again

(Chorus)
I was lost inside the world's great size, couldn't break away
Got lost inside the dreamy words, the things I'd never say
True or false, no struggle, I don't care what they might say
I once turned my youth into her, a frantic, wild ballet
My fingertips could conjure up the summer in a day
Whatever moves the heart, just let it go and drift away
Walking against the light, let the wind and hard rain play

(Verse 2)
This short road, I walk and stop, a distance starts to grow
Am I touching a story or a feeling, I don't know
Maybe all I'm hoping for is to fight against the flow
To see you one more time, in the morning's gentle glow
Smiling, oh so sweetly, a sight I used to know

(Chorus)
I was lost inside the world's great size, couldn't break away
Got lost inside the dreamy words, the things I'd never say
True or false, no struggle, I don't care what they might say
I once turned my youth into her, a frantic, wild ballet
My fingertips could conjure up the summer in a day
Whatever moves the heart, just let it go and drift away

(Outro)
The evening wind blows through the white that's in your hair
It smooths the scars that memory left, beyond all disrepair
Your eyes are mixed with light and dark, a flower blooms in air
The twilight hides your stumbling steps, a burden that you bear
You walk into the painting that was hidden by the stair
In the painting, your head is down, you're speaking soft and low, a prayer.
I still marvel at the world's great size, its endless, grand design
And I'm still drunk on childhood words, that once were yours and mine
No truth or lies, no struggle, man, the jokes are just a line
I finally gave my youth to her, a love I can't define
Along with summer at my fingertips, a feeling so divine
Whatever moves the heart, has gone... and with the wind, entwined.

Plucked

(Verse)

Am I still unwilling to admit my calling from the skies?

Boil

(Verse 1)
How you gotta act to make it look like you're at ease?
Sometimes you wanna hide out, catch a gentle breeze
Love is strange, I know it is, different frequencies
But even from another universe, we found our keys
Woo, first learn to love yourself, that's the base
Woo, then we can share our thoughts, find our space
Woo, slowly adaptin' to this two-person world we face

(Chorus)
You help me open up my taste, the bitter, spicy, sour, sweet
Taught me how to heal myself, accept my own defeat
It's okay, it's okay, let life slowly start to boil
Yeah, with the sweet and salty seasons of our earthly toil

(Verse 2 - Rap)
Your weirdness, I adore it, got me fully focused, even when I lose control
My heart's a black hole, yeah, it can consume you whole
Press the pause button, come and dance with me, a little rock and roll
Your smile's the only seasonin' I need to feed my soul
Soul jazz vibe, déjà vu, feel it in the air
Maybe in a different space-time, but I know that you'll be there
Learn to let some things go, wait for you to come up close, as a pair
We're cookin' all day long, a gentle kind of care
Servin' up the perfect feelin', somethin' we can share

(Chorus)
You help me open up my taste, the bitter, spicy, sour, sweet
Taught me how to heal myself, accept my own defeat
It's okay, it's okay, let life slowly start to boil
Yeah, with the sweet and salty seasons of our earthly toil

(Bridge)
In spring we see the shy flowers (You know about that)
In summer I'm with you for hours (I'm with you for hours)
In autumn we walk through the leaves (In our two-person world)
In winter you warm me with ease (Yeah you know we're cookin' cookin' all along)
It's okay, it's okay (It's okay, it's okay)
This feeling, this feeling's a beautiful bouquet
Hope that every single season's got your flavor on display.

Free For Me

(Verse 1)
They all wanna escape, get away from this place
But for me, it's whatever, I don't feel the chase
Maybe the world already forgot my name, my face
I don't wanna be a demon, when you see me, run away
Maybe from the start, we were destined to turn our backs
Who falls in love with who? Who covers up the cracks?
In this city, happy people watch the fireworks glow
And then you found me, like an angel, put me on a different row
Tryna pull me from the vortex that was sealin' up my soul

(Bridge)
I can't forget the tears you cried, the light within your eyes
I don't deserve you, but I made you compromise
Each crystal tear you buried deep inside your sight
Lit up the cold and empty dark, and made the blackness bright
You said you felt my pain and all the sins I had to pay
Told me to believe in beauty after stormy days
But how can I piece this together? It's all broken and undone
My hope for the future's gone, man, I'm on the run

(Verse 2)
I feel so lonely, scrollin' through the scenes on my phone screen
Why's my vision got a double? What's this hazy scene?
How do I dodge the dark clouds that are hangin' over me?
The sea won't give me oxygen, it will not set me free
The sky won't give me wings to fly, so I can never leave
You met me at the wrong time, all I give you is deceive
The only thing I'll bring to you is disappointment, please believe.

(Chorus)
They all wanna escape, get away from this place
But for me, it's whatever, I don't feel the chase
Maybe the world already forgot my name, my face
I don't wanna be a demon, when you see me, run away
Maybe from the start, we were destined to turn our backs
Who falls in love with who? Who covers up the cracks?
In this city, happy people watch the fireworks glow
And then you found me, like an angel, put me on a different row
Tryna pull me from the vortex that was sealin' up my soul

(Outro)
You better run, better run, better run
Before your pure white clothes get stained by what I've done
I even hate myself for this, for being this way now
Push everyone away but can't open the window anyhow
These bad emotions torture me, a slow and painful art
A feeble struggle couldn't keep her from falling apart
Loneliness is wrapped around me, no escape, no brand new start
Go and see the world's beauty for me
Go and breathe the freshest air for me
Go be brave for me, be free for me.

Proud

(Verse)
Scared to run away, scared of being left behind
If I fail, who's gonna be the first to be unkind?
Keep on guessin' why, why I gotta run so fast ahead?
Even if I fall and stumble, fill my heart with dread
Wanna make 'em proud of me, the words that I have said.

(Chorus)
Runnin', runnin'
Yeah, I'll be covered in my scars
Arrivin', arrivin'
Wounds will heal beneath the stars
But perfection is the price you pay for being numb inside
And our flaws are the fireworks we should never try to hide.

Winter Without You

(Verse 1)
The day you left, the weather suddenly got cold
The whole world turned to ice, a story to be told
Made it through the autumn, but how do I face the night?
Livin' through the long dark hours without you in my sight
I tried so hard to get used to just being on my own
But I lost the fight to memories of a love that we had known
The warmth I can't forget, the longing's getting deep
Loneliness, it cuts right through me, secrets that I keep

(Chorus)
See the snowflakes fallin' on my window, buildin' up my pain
A frozen moment in my mind, drivin' me insane
The wind blows through this winter, a world without your face
The whole world is so cold and sharp, lost without a trace
The window pane is cryin' now, it's weepin' with my soul
Relivin' every moment, losing all control
The love you said you had for me, it had a deadline date
I'm countin' time without you, in this lonely, bitter state
Can't learn to say goodbye to you, sealed my own damn fate

(Outro)
Why'd you say goodbye so easy? Left me in the grey
Gave up all the memories of a happy yesterday
When I close my eyes I see your face, clear as the light of day
Is it 'cause I can't forget? Or am I just a fool to stay?
Lost inside this world without you, come what may.

Not Your White Horse

(Verse 1)
I got no right to call your number on the phone
That simple set of digits, now I'm on my own
I admit it, yeah, it's my fault, I deserve the blame
Only understood your struggle when you walked out of the game

(Verse 2)
The promises I made to you, to see the ocean spray
Have all turned into tears upon my pillow where I lay
From the day you walked away from me and shut the door
My world just lost its color, it's not vibrant anymore
All that's left is empty space, a hollow, barren core

(Chorus)
Such a shame I couldn't be your white horse in the end
Couldn't get down on one knee, couldn't be your friend
Couldn't see you in a wedding dress, a sight I'll never know
Lost your special kind of love, and now I have to grow
The one who loved me so damn much, I pushed you far away
Didn't know what I had, until I saw you go that day

(Chorus 2)
Such a shame I couldn't be your white horse, in the light
Couldn't hold a flower for you, make your future bright
Couldn't act out the fairytale, couldn't make it right
If there's a next time, let me be the one who takes the fall
Let me be the one to feel the pain and lose it all.

(Bridge)
When the memories attack me, they're a tidal wave of pain
Surging, rushing, in my mind, a relentless, driving rain
On a loop inside my brain, I hear your last goodbye
The thoughts of you are hard to bear, I can't even try
This is my punishment for sure, for the love I let pass by
'Cause I didn't treasure what you gave, I didn't even try
And in the end I watched you turn your back and say goodbye.

(Chorus)
Such a shame I couldn't be your white horse in the end
Couldn't get down on one knee, couldn't be your friend
Couldn't see you in a wedding dress, a sight I'll never know
Lost your special kind of love, and now I have to grow
The one who loved me so damn much, I pushed you far away
Didn't know what I had, until I saw you go that day

(Chorus 2)
Such a shame I couldn't be your white horse, in the light
Couldn't hold a flower for you, make your future bright
Couldn't act out the fairytale, couldn't make it right
If there's a next time, let me be the one who takes the fall
If there's a next time, let me be the one who takes the fall.

There Will Always Be Someone

(Verse 1)
Night falls, and the tears are loud, who's got you feelin' low?
You took a tumble on love's road, don't mean you didn't grow
The right one's always runnin' late, a joke that fate has planned
What ain't yours, don't force it, what is yours is in your hand
It can't escape, you understand?

(Chorus)
There will always be someone who holds you more dear than their own life, it's true
There will always be someone who finds all the good things inside of you
There will always be someone to hug the pain that's hiding behind your smile
Make you feel the world's not so bad, stay with you for a while

(Chorus 2)
There will always be someone who'd give up the world to not leave you behind
Who'd be proud to have you by their side, a one-of-a-kind find
There will always be someone who wants to lean on your shoulder, strong and true
Make you feel that you are needed, for being simply you.

(Verse 2)
Day breaks, and you keep on runnin', laugh away the pain
On that road where no one asks, you gotta make it through the rain
Take care of yourself, you hear me? That's the one thing you must do
The right one's always runnin' late, a joke for me and you
What ain't yours, don't force it, what is yours will see you through.

(Chorus)
There will always be someone who holds you more dear than their own life, it's true
There will always be someone who finds all the good things inside of you
There will always be someone to hug the pain that's hiding behind your smile
Make you feel the world's not so bad, stay with you for a while

(Chorus 2)
There will always be someone who'd give up the world to not leave you behind
Who'd be proud to have you by their side, a one-of-a-kind find
There will always be someone who wants to lean on your shoulder, strong and true
Make you feel that you are needed, for being simply you.

Dong Dong

(Verse 1)
I run to you headfirst, I must be the most devoted cephalopod
Your slippers by the bed, can't find you, man, I must be a fraud
The way I am right now, is all because of what you made of me
You ask me why I'm so damn dumb
I ask me why I'm so damn dumb

(Chorus)

Love of My Life (For Now)

(Verse 1)
Writin' long letters for a bond that was so brief
With a poet's pen, a photographer's belief
Too used to digging up their ever-changing hearts
Sometimes I wanna be a ruin, torn to all its parts

(Pre-Chorus)
About people comin' and a-goin'
About people stoppin' and a-flowin'

(Chorus)
I guess we only have right now, this moment, you and I
A secret night, the lights are low, beneath the city sky
The sadness is so difficult, the happiness so fast
When you're not here, on the other side of clouds that never last

(Verse 2)
Walkin' a long road to act in a short film
Two coffee cups, one blurry reflection, on the window trim
Too used to rehearsing all their goodbye scenes, you see
'Til the whole damn city's a graveyard of kisses, for you and me

(Pre-Chorus)
About people comin' and a-goin'
About people stoppin' and a-flowin'

(Chorus)
I guess we only have right now, this moment, you and I
A secret night, the lights are low, beneath the city sky
The sadness is so difficult, the happiness so fast
When you're not here, on the other side of clouds that never last
Fate and destiny don't know what's good for them, it's true
Only the love of my whole life, right now, is me and you
The happiness too quick, the sadness is too plain
When you're not here on this side of the endless, fallin' rain

(Bridge)
It's all for the best, it's the best plan
The unknown next stop, the sun on the sand
A coastline of gold, a future unplanned

(Outro)
We still have so many "right nows"
Only the love of my whole life, right now, making silent vows.

Running

(Verse 1)
Every morning when I wake up from my sleep
I can feel your eyes on me, a promise that you keep
Hearing the sound of my own voice talking to you
My ears become like airplanes, soaring in the blue

(Chorus)
Running running running running
Running running running running
Happy smiles, we're dancing, never gonna stop
Running running running running
Running running running running

(Verse 2)
You walk on over, then you walk away from me
Following your footsteps, running wild and free
Smiling as I see the smile that's spread across your face
Like a sunflower, so precious, full of love and grace
Holding onto happiness, running in this race
You walk and then you stop and look at me in this place
Like you're telling me something, a truth I can't deny:

(Outro)
"I'll be here forever, waiting 'til the day you fly
Back home to me, my dearest love," a tear forms in my eye.

Right on Time

(Verse 1)
I'm still up in the tree, y'all are headin' to the mart
Some of you are gettin' packed in boxes, torn apart
Feelin' a little nervous, yeah, a little bit of fright?
I'm still on the road, this is my fashion, my true light
The waves of pain I've surfed, the heart I've thrown away
It's all there on the timeline, at the closing of the day
I'm still up in the tree, y'all are headin' to the mart
Following the time and weather, playin' out my part
Every now and then I have a fantasy, a dream
I'm still on the road, from this moment, it would seem
I'm forgetting all the sadness, the pain, the bitter cost
The road back home, what detours, am I truly lost?
There's always time to catch up, no matter what I've tossed.

(Bridge - Spoken)
Sanmao said, as long as your heart says "okay,"
No place is too far away.
I think, if I let your heart be, if you're good, then I'm good too.
When things go south, just let it flow
This is the art of letting go
The scenery is outta control, this flow, you know
Belongs to the southern warmth, a gentle, easy glow
And after that, I'm gonna go to Glasgow
That is all I could ever know
You have your freedom to chase, I have my feelings to show.

(Verse 2)
I don't need the boring chatter, the empty, hollow talk
I don't need a reckless train on a rusty, old train track
I don't need the brilliant stars up in the midnight black
Please just give me something real, that always has my back
I'm on the road, on the road
I'm on the road, on the road
How to say it, how to do it?
Life is strong, but also weak
If it falls, can it bear fruit?
Gotta say what you need to speak.
I'm on the road.

A Love That Never Ends

(Verse 1)
Not knowing, not asking, not hurting, not caring, how much time has passed?
An uncertain night, in a small alley, the tears are flowing fast
The weather on the street is cool, the moonlight's soft and low, I hum along the way
Searching for the fate we never found, tied up and led astray

(Bridge)
I can't feel you being strong for me, it's just a front you build
I can feel you telling lies to me, a promise unfulfilled
I'm quietly listening to Chopin, with Vienna's sad refrain
A melody of sorrow, a symphony of pain

(Chorus)
Your love is buried deep, your hate is put away, the pain should be forgiven now
My love needs no announcement, my hate needs no vow, the longing's burning anyhow
Watching your face, you're carrying your bag, you say you're going far away
Who still remembers that year when I held your hand and said our love is here to stay?

(Rap Verse)
I don't get it, why so many true loves end up in a mess?
Two people drift apart, a story of distress
Back then we said we'd have a love that would never, ever break
Did that promise just become the chain that caused our hearts to ache?
Don't think too much, don't think too much, maybe I'll understand it more
Don't say no more, don't say no more, let's just let the silence roar
Now we finally get the ending, but we can't rewrite the scene
This "love that never breaks up," I guess the ending's truly mean
It was destined to fail from the start, a heartbreaking routine.

(Chorus)
Your love is buried deep, your hate is put away, the pain should be forgiven now
My love needs no announcement, my hate needs no vow, the longing's burning anyhow
Watching your face, you're carrying your bag, you say you're going far away
Who still remembers that year when I held your hand and said our love is here to stay?

Don't Worry 'Bout Me

(Verse 1)
Been a long time since I got a letter from your hand
Been a long time since I had someone who'd understand
I miss your eyes, as gentle as the water in a stream
They were the most beautiful stars in my forgotten dream
The midnight in a foreign land is exceptionally cold
Just a man and his own heart, a story to be told
I wonder if you feel it, from so far away from me
This signal that I'm sending, for only you to see.

(Verse 2)
I never dared to make a promise, never said the words out loud
'Cause I knew that we were too young, lost inside the crowd
You were chasing a romantic feeling, a picture in your head
Or a passion with no consequences, lying in your bed
The words within my heart, I'm only telling you right now
I don't know if you will wake up, if you'll take a bow
So the me who's far away from here won't have to worry 'bout you
Hoping that you'll understand, and know my love is true.

(Chorus)
A heart that's full of love for you, is spinning endlessly
My love has also warmed your soul, I know you felt it, see?
Between you and that other one, is there a real connection?
Don't hide it from me, tell me now, don't fear my own dejection
Don't be afraid you'll hurt me, I can handle the rejection.

Name

(Verse)
I heard that "I'm sorry" is another kind of vow
If we can be together doesn't matter anyhow
Strictly speaking, we were boyfriend, girlfriend, back in school
Just some words we said out loud, a childish, simple rule
I walked you to your alley, we were quiet on the way
'Cause our hands were locked together, nothing left to say
Can't remember the reason, yeah, it's common, I suppose
Just a memory of a feeling, that's the way it goes.

Moment

(Verse 1)
I think I can't say for sure which day you'll come back home
But too much longing's pressing on the clock's slow metronome
I like the broken pieces in the deep and quiet night
Where I can be alone and bold, outside of people's sight
Too much to care about, the light's too damn bright
Before it burns out, you appear before my eyes
Just pretend it's my illusion, slow it down, just for a while
If I could turn back all my thoughts, and change my inner dial
Before this moment, if I could've swapped my place with you
How would you make the time reverse? What would you try to do?
The moment that we just missed, how would you change the scene?
I don't wanna wake up with a piece of me that's been
Erased or taken from me, a part I can't redeem
Forgetting is the worst-case plan, the final, dying dream
So clean, so simple, so extreme.

(Verse 2)
The shy photo that you took, the very first one that we made
You made me press the button, all my fears began to fade
That relaxed and easy side of me, you brought it to the light
And then it slowly fell apart, and faded from my sight
The day we said a "see you later," holding back the tears
Who would have thought that that would be the last for all these years?
The final time we'd ever see each other face to face
Before this moment, we were holding on in this place
So certain we would be okay, we'd conquer time and space
Said we'd always be together, watch the ocean's endless race
Now I'm waiting here alone, an empty, hollow space.
My powerlessness became my fatal flaw, my great defeat
I can't pretend that I don't care, I can't just take a seat
All that I can do is just repeat, repeat, repeat...
Forgetting is the worst, the final, bitter, black defeat
So clean, so simple, so complete.
Losing weight until I lose control, can't get back on my feet
No reason, you already see, how can you believe me when I say "I'm not in pain"?
How do you want the time to turn? The loss becomes a gain?
I don't wanna wake up with a piece of me that's slain
Forgetting is the worst-case plan, the endless, driving rain
So clean, so simple, so insane.

This Life's Fate

(Chorus)
We have a fate in this life, on the road we roam
As long as we never forget the path that leads us home
Oh, my friends, let's hold this moment, burn it in our minds
Don't you worry 'bout the sorrow and the pain that life unwinds

(Verse 1)
We are destined for the changes of a world that's vast and wide
We came in crying, we should leave with a smile and with our pride
Oh, my friends, let's hold this moment, burn it in our minds
Our brotherhood in this life is the greatest thing we'll find

(Chorus)
We have a fate in this life, on the road we roam
As long as we never forget the path that leads us home
Oh, my friends, let's hold this moment, burn it in our minds
Don't you worry 'bout the sorrow and the pain that life unwinds

(Verse 2)
This life is like a dream, it's a fleeting, hazy sight
If I have you here to drink with me, then what is wrong or right?
Oh, my friends, let's hold this moment, burn it in our minds
After all this dust has settled, there is nothing left behind.
Yeah, my friends, let's hold this moment, burn it in our minds
After all this dust has settled, there is nothing left behind.

Rhyme

(Verse 1)
I admit, I'm a little bit clumsy, it's true
Not good with sweet words, that's just how I do
But I'll give you my heart, every piece, every part
That's a promise I'll keep, a brand new start

(Chorus)
Rubia, Rubia, my love, so bright
Like the sunshine, warm and full of light
Rubia, Rubia, my love, you see
Never gonna change, always gonna be

(Verse 2)
Maybe I'm not the best, not the most romantic guy
But my actions will show you, as the days go by
Proof of my love for you, in everything I do
A feeling so strong, so honest, so true

(Chorus)
Rubia, Rubia, my love, so bright
Like the sunshine, warm and full of light
Rubia, Rubia, my love, you see
Never gonna change, always gonna be

(Bridge)
I just wanna be with you, through every season's turn
Creating our memories, lessons we will learn
Until we grow old, and the fires gently burn

(Chorus)
Rubia, Rubia, my love, so bright
Like the sunshine, warm and full of light
Rubia, Rubia, my love, you see
Never gonna change, always gonna be

(Outro)
Rubia, Rubia
My love.

The Taste of Autumn Eggplant

(Verse 1)
The taste of autumn eggplant, bitter and so deep
Wandering through the city's corners, secrets I will keep
Where you live, the planes fly over, a constant, buzzing sound
Between us, two countries' treaties, never on solid ground
Sitting by the lake in the afternoon, the wind begins to blow
In the sunset's golden light, the lake starts to glow
Shimmering and shining, a beautiful display
Our ceasefire agreement, like an autumn eggplant, wilting away.

(Chorus)
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant
Autumn eggplant

Ice Bloom

(Verse 1)
Landing near the earth, like a newborn's cry
The only secret left alive, a perfect branch so high
The ice bloom slowly withers, hope completely erased
But I can speak, I cannot speak, my thoughts are out of place
I can act, I cannot act, I'm stuck inside this space
Ignorant, shameless, fearless, brave, I'm running out of time
No joy, no anger, no worry, no glee, I'm losing all my rhyme
No thought, no memory, no jealousy, no self, a hollow, empty climb
Coming to this world was forced, a destiny defined
Leaving it in freedom, a choice I'm glad to find
Better to sing and laugh, through bitter human days
If I had one more moment, I'd find a million ways.

(Miao Language - Roughly: I am a Miao child, climbing a tall mountain, searching for a body, descending a slope, looking for a companion, building a village. The water is long, the road is too steep, not easy to walk. It was so hard to grow, life was too short.)

(Chorus)
Coming to this world was forced, a destiny defined
Leaving it in freedom, a choice I'm glad to find
Better to sing and laugh, through bitter human days
If I had one more moment, I'd find a million ways.

(Chanting)
Flowers break through ice to grow, waiting for their souls to fly
Passing through this barren world, hard to live beneath the sky.

One Love is Enough

(Verse 1)
One love is enough, then back to our own time and space
This time you said we missed it, leaving not a trace
The swallows outside the window, can't fly anymore, it seems
Heaven and earth are turning to dust, dissolving all our dreams
The crimson flowers dyed in ink, a somber, silent hue
Hoping our fate won't decay, me and you
Cold as ice, but with a fire inside, that's what you possess
Cruel as arsenic, but deep love for me, it's what you express
The secret of the time-space rift, a gentle, piercing knife
Stabs me deep, cuts me open, ending all my strife.

(Chorus)
Always be my love, memories can't escape your clue
Always be my love, we can't hold on, me and you
If one love is enough, then back to our own time and space
This time you said we missed it, no turning back, no trace
In the time-space intersection, you pressed the pause button for a while
My heart crept closer, crept closer, with a subtle, gentle smile
Oh, one love is enough, if we missed it, find another way to stay.

(Verse 2)
Playing the most romantic movie just for you, you see
Projecting it in memories, for only you and me
Unexpectedly, you crashed into my life, a destined, perfect start
Not enough time to tell you, all my longing tore me apart
All my thoughts became a river, flowing from my heart.

(Chorus)
Always be my love, memories can't escape your clue
Always be my love, we can't hold on, me and you
If one love is enough, then back to our own time and space
This time you said we missed it, no turning back, no trace
In the time-space intersection, you pressed the pause button for a while
My heart crept closer, crept closer, with a subtle, gentle smile
Oh, one love is enough, if we missed it, find another way to stay.

(Outro)
The swallows outside the window, can't fly anymore, it seems
Heaven and earth are turning to dust, dissolving all our dreams

Cold as ice, but with a fire inside, that's what you possess
Cruel as arsenic, but deep love for me, it's what you express
One love is enough, then back to our own time and space
This time you said we missed it, with not a single trace.

The Last of the Mohicans

My heart is filled with sorrow
For the loss of my dear one
The last of the Mohicans
He's gone, he's gone forever

The wind whispers his name
The trees weep for his passing
The river flows with tears
The last of the Mohicans, he's gone

He fought with courage and might
For his people, for his land
But fate was cruel, and he fell
The last of the Mohicans, he's gone

His spirit will live on
In the hearts of his people
In the legends they tell
The last of the Mohicans, he's gone

He's gone, he's gone forever
The last of the Mohicans, he's gone

Revival of the Defeated

(Verse 1)
I was once the king of the defeated, rising from the dirt
Fell down hard, but got back up, put in all the work
My heart is filled with power, a fire burning bright
Just for that direction, a guiding, shining light

(Chorus)
The scorn of yesterday, the applause of today
My efforts weren't in vain, I found my righteous way
I'm gonna prove it to everyone, all of them will see
I am the best, the strongest, the one that I can be.

(Verse 2)
Revival of the defeated, never saying die
My dreams will never fade, they reach up to the sky
Revival of the defeated, breaking every chain
My life is full of wonder, overcoming all the pain

(Bridge)
Maybe there's confusion, maybe I'm afraid
But the compass in my heart, its course will never fade
Clench your fists and be brave, go chase your destiny
The dawn of victory is waiting, for you and for me.

(Chorus)
Revival of the defeated, never saying die
My dreams will never fade, they reach up to the sky

I Turn Stories into Wine

(Verse 1)
I turn my stories into wine, a vintage, sweet and deep
One cup for the past, the memories I keep
One cup for my freedom, soaring to the sky
One cup for tomorrow, as the moments hurry by
One cup for the future, reaching far and wide
One cup for you, my dearest, always by my side
One cup for myself, with nothing left to hide.

(Verse 2)
My story has you in it, and me, it's clear and bright
With tears and laughter, bitter, sweet, and full of light
My story, turned to wine, a spirit strong and true
One sip to drink it all, and wash away the blue.

(Bridge)
Maybe there are regrets, maybe I can't let go
But these are all the marks of growth, a journey I now know
Be brave to face it all, be brave to break away
Live out the most beautiful you, every single day.

I turn my stories into wine, a vintage, sweet and deep
One cup for the past, the memories I keep

Thank You for Coming

(Verse 1)
Thank you for coming into my life, a beacon, strong and clear
Bringing me the sunshine and the warmth, chasing all my fear
Thank you for coming into my world, a brand new, shining space
Bringing me the happiness and hope, leaving not a trace
Of the sadness that was there before, a forgotten, distant place.

Maybe we have small imperfections, breaking all the laws
But our love is the purest, the most honest, true, and deep

Time to say goodbye, my love, our journey's reached its end
Though it breaks my heart to leave you, I know we'll meet again

Forever in my heart, you'll light my darkest day
Until we meet again someday.

Too Much

(Verse 1)
The love you gave me, too, too, too much, it's true
I cannot bear it, cannot carry through
Your tenderness, too, too, too much, I see
It drowns me deep inside, I cannot break free.

(Chorus)
Too much love, too much feeling, losing all control
It makes me lose myself, body and my soul
Too much love, too much pain, a suffocating hold
It makes me gasp for air, stories left untold.

But my love for you, is the purest of its kind
I don't want to give up, my feelings, they still grow

(Verse 1)
Talk to me, my dearest love, my heart is full of pain
My mind is filled with longing, like a never-ending rain
Talk to me, my dearest love, my world has lost its hue
It's empty, cold, and colorless, without you.

(Verse 2)
Talk to me, my dearest love, my heart is filled with dread
My mind is filled with sorrow, words I left unsaid
Talk to me, my dearest love, my love is in the past
A broken, faded memory, designed to never last.

(Bridge)
Maybe I'm too foolish, maybe I'm too blind
But my love for you, is the purest of its kind
I don't want to give up, my feelings, they still grow
I just want to silently wait for you, let my true feelings show.

(Chorus)
Talk to me, my dearest love, my heart is full of pain
My mind is filled with longing, like a never-ending rain
Talk to me, my dearest love, my world has lost its hue
It's empty, cold, and colorless, without you.

Sparrow

(Verse 1)
I am a little, little sparrow, flying high and free
Beneath the blue sky, living wild and carefree
I am a little, little sparrow, singing out my song
Full of happiness and joy, where I truly belong.

(Verse 2)
Maybe I don't have fancy clothes, a wardrobe grand and bold
Maybe I don't have a singing voice, a story to be told
But I have the truest heart, sincere and warm and bright
Silently dedicating myself, shining in the light.

(Chorus)
Sparrow, sparrow, my sparrow, singing just for you
Forever, never stopping, always shining through
Sparrow, sparrow, my sparrow, loving you so deep
To eternity, never changing, promises to keep.

(Bridge)
Maybe there's a storm, maybe there's a wild typhoon
But as long as you're beside me, beneath the silent moon
Everything finds meaning, everything makes sense anew
Sparrow, sparrow, never lonely, for me and for you.

Commanding all the storms, conquering all the pain.

The Great Road East

(Verse 1)
The great road east, I walk the four directions, wide and free
My heart is filled with hope, for all that's meant to be
The great road east, I wander through the lands, a restless soul
My world is filled with dreams, making me truly whole.

(Verse 2)
The great road east, I walk the four directions, strong and true
My heart is filled with power, in everything I do
The great road east, I wander through the lands, no turning back
My life is filled with wonder, on this destined, shining track.

Maybe there's confusion, maybe there's a fear
But the compass in my heart, its course is always clear
Clench your fists and be brave, go chase your destiny
The dawn of victory is waiting, for you and for me.

The great road east, I walk the four directions, wide and free
My heart is filled with hope, for all that's meant to be

Why Do Those Who Say "I Love You" First Leave First?

(Verse 1)
The one who said "I love you" first, why did they leave me now?
My heart is filled with sorrow, a broken, silent vow
The one who said "I love you" first, why did they leave me here?
My love is now a memory, lost to all my fear.

(Bridge)
Maybe I'm too foolish, maybe I'm too blind
But my love for you, is the purest of its kind
I don't want to give up, my feelings, they still grow
I just want to silently wait for you, let my true feelings show.

(Chorus)
The one who said "I love you" first, why did they leave me now?
My heart is filled with sorrow, a broken, silent vow
The one who said "I love you" first, why did they leave me here?
My love is now a memory, lost to all my fear.

(Outro)
Love is the only superpower, the only thing I need
Giving me the courage to pursue you, plant a loving seed
No matter how far, no matter how long, my love will never cease
I'll always be waiting for you, bringing inner peace.

Passed By

We passed through wind and rain, through storms and cloudy skies
We passed through rugged paths, beneath each other's eyes
We passed through laughter and joy, moments sweet and bright
We passed through sadness and tears, in the darkest, lonely night.

Maybe we have small imperfections, breaking all the laws
